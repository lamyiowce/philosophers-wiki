He was born in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Divine Recognition, K. C.

Another one of his very important contributions was in the field of philosophy of aesthetics with his famous ''[[Abhinavabharati|Abhinavabhāratī]]'' commentary of ''[[Natya Shastra|Nāṭyaśāstra]]'' of [[Bharata Muni]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page LXXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aenesidemus''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Αἰνησίδημος ''Ainēsidēmos'') was a [[Greece|Greek]] sceptical philosopher, born in [[Knossos]] on the island of [[Crete]]. He lived in the 1st century BC, taught in [[Alexandria]] and flourished shortly after the life of [[Cicero]]. He was probably a member of [[Plato's Academy]], but due to his rejection of their theories he revived the principle of ''[[epoché]]'' (εποχή), or suspended judgement, originally proposed by [[Pyrrho]] and [[Timon (philosopher)|Timon]], as a solution to what he considered to be the insoluble problems of [[epistemology]]. His school is most commonly referred to as [[Pyrrhonism]], but also as the third [[Philosophical skepticism|sceptic]] school. His chief work, the ''Pyrrhoneia'' (Πυρρώνειοι λóγοι) discussed four main ideas: the reasons for scepticism and doubt, arguments against causality and truth, a physical theory and an ethical theory. Of these, the former are the most significant and his reasons for the suspension of judgment were organized into ten &quot;tropes&quot;, or modes. Very little is known about him as none of his works have survived, though he has been mentioned and discussed in detail by [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (in his ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Myriobiblion]]'') and [[Sextus Empiricus]], and also to a lesser extent by [[Diogenes Laertius]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]].

== Life ==
There is no definite evidence about the life of Aenesidemus, but his most important work, the ''Pyrrhoneia'' was known to be dedicated to Lucius Tubero, a friend of [[Cicero]] and member of [[Plato's Academy]]. Based on this information, scholars have assumed that Aenesidemus himself was also a member of the Academy. Furthermore, it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of [[Philo of Larissa]] and probably developed his sceptical philosophy in reaction to Philo's [[fallibilism]].

Born in [[Clazomenae]] in [[Asia Minor]], Anaxagoras was the first to bring philosophy to [[Athens]]. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]] and [[Plutarch]], in later life he was charged with [[impiety]] and went into exile in [[Lampsacus]]; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with [[Pericles]].

Responding to the claims of [[Parmenides]] on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, &quot;each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it&quot;.&lt;ref name=Curd&gt;{{cite book|author=Anaxagoras|editor1-last=Curd|editor1-first=Patricia|title=A Presocratics Reader|publisher=Hackett|isbn=978-1-60384-305-8|chapter=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae|quote=B12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was [[homogeneous]], or nearly so.

'''Anaximander''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|n|æ|k|s|ɨ|ˈ|m|æ|n|d|ər}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναξίμανδρος}} ''Anaximandros''; c. 610 – c. 546 BC) was a [[pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]],&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;&quot;Anaximander&quot; in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; a city of [[Ionia]] (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the [[Milesian school]] and learned the teachings of his master [[Thales]]. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and, arguably, [[Pythagoras]] amongst his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.de/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Porphyry%2C+Life+of+Pythagoras+Anaximander|title=Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras Anaximander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Themistius]], ''Oratio'' 36, §317&lt;/ref&gt; although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.

He was an early proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.&lt;ref&gt;Park, David (2005) ''The Grand Contraption'', Princeton University Press ISBN 0-691-12133-8&lt;/ref&gt; Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's contributions to [[philosophy]] relate to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], he tried to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.  29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie115&quot;/&gt; This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what Anaximenes is principally known for today.

==Anaximenes and the Arche==
While his predecessors [[Thales]] and Anaximander proposed that the ''[[arche|archai]]'' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: ''arche'', meaning the underlying material of the world) were water and the ambiguous substance ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'', respectively, Anaximenes asserted that air was this primary substance of which all other things are made (it should be noted that Anaximenes' idea of air, or aer, is more like a dense mist that what we think of as air, which is ideally transparent).  The choice of air may seem arbitrary, but Anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, W.K.C. &quot;The Milesians: Anaximenes.&quot; ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; When air condenses it becomes visible, as mist and then rain and other forms of precipitation. As the condensed air cools Anaximenes supposed that it went on to form earth and ultimately stones. In contrast, water evaporates into air,&lt;!--can see how he thought that, the water disappears...--&gt; which ignites and produces flame&lt;!--...but what is this supposed to be based on?--&gt; when further rarefied.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie124&quot;&gt;Guthrie, W.K.C. &quot;The Milesians: Anaximenes.&quot; ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 124-126.&lt;/ref&gt;  While other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the quality pairs hot/dry and cold/wet with the density of a single material and add a quantitative dimension to the Milesian [[material monism|monistic system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie124&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield. &quot;Anaximenes of Miletus.&quot; ''The Presocratic Philosophers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origin of the Cosmos==
Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air, Anaximenes used his theory to devise a scheme that explains the origins and nature of the earth and the surrounding celestial bodies.  Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air. In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars. While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars, but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield. &quot;Anaximenes of Miletus.&quot; ''The Presocratic Philosophers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.  152-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air. In his theory, when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth, but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant. Anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Arthur. &quot;[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/TEACH/28000/DavisUniversal.pdf Anaximenes]&quot;.

'''Antisthenes''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|s|θ|ɨ|n|iː|z|}};&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel; Roach, Peter, James Hartman and Jane Setter, eds. ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary''. 17th edition. Cambridge UP, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-el|Ἀντισθένης}}; c. 445 – c. 365 BC) was a [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] and a pupil of [[Socrates]]. Antisthenes first learned [[rhetoric]] under [[Gorgias]] before becoming an ardent disciple of [[Socrates]]. He adopted and developed the [[ethical]] side of Socrates' teachings, advocating an [[ascetic]] life lived in accordance with [[virtue]]. Later writers regarded him as the founder of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy.

==Life==
Antisthenes was born c. 445 BC and was the son of Antisthenes, an [[Athenian]].  His mother was a [[Thracians|Thracian]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Suda]]'', ''Antisthenes''.; Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he fought at [[Battle of Tanagra (426 BC)|Tanagra]] (426 BC), and was a disciple first of [[Gorgias]], and then of [[Socrates]], at whose death he was present.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedo'', 59b.&lt;/ref&gt; He never forgave his master's persecutors, and is said to have been instrumental in procuring their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He survived the [[Battle of Leuctra]] (371 BC), as he is reported to have compared the victory of the [[Thebans]] to a set of schoolboys beating their master.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lycurgus'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although one source tells us that he died at the age of 70,&lt;ref&gt;Eudocia, ''Violarium'', 96&lt;/ref&gt; he was apparently still alive in 366 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, xv. 76.4&lt;/ref&gt; and he must have been nearer to 80 years old when he died at Athens, c. 365 BC. He is said to have lectured at the [[Cynosarges]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 13&lt;/ref&gt; a gymnasium for the use of Athenians born of foreign mothers, near the temple of [[Herakles|Heracles]].  [[Diogenes Laërtius]] says that his works filled ten volumes, but of these, only fragments remain. His favourite style seems to have been dialogues, some of them being vehement attacks on his contemporaries, as on [[Alcibiades]] in the second of his two works entitled ''Cyrus'', on [[Gorgias]] in his ''Archelaus'' and on [[Plato]] in his ''Satho''.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, v. 220c-e&lt;/ref&gt; His style was pure and elegant, and [[Theopompus]] even said that Plato stole from him many of his thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, xi. 508c-d&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]], after reading some works by Antisthenes, found his works pleasing and called him &quot;a man more intelligent than learned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Κῦρος δ᾽, ε᾽ mihi sic placuit ut cetera Antisthenis, hominis acuti magis quam eruditi.''&quot; Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Atticum'', Book XII, Letter 38, section 2. In English translation: &quot;Books four (δ᾽) and five (ε᾽) of ''Cyrus'' I found as pleasing as the others composed by Antisthenes, he is a man who is sharp rather than learned.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He possessed considerable powers of wit and sarcasm, and was fond of playing upon words; saying, for instance, that he would rather fall among crows (''korakes'') than flatterers (''kolakes''), for the one devour the dead, but the other the living.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Two declamations have survived, named ''Ajax'' and ''Odysseus'', which are purely rhetorical.

Arcesilaus succeeded [[Crates of Athens|Crates]] as the sixth head ([[scholarch]]) of the Academy c. 264 BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/arcesil.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He did not preserve his thoughts in writing, so his opinions can only be gleaned second-hand from what is preserved by later writers. He was the first Academic to adopt a position of [[philosophical skepticism]], that is, he doubted the ability of the [[senses]] to discover [[truth]] about the world, although he may have continued to believe in the existence of truth itself. This brought in the skeptical phase of the Academy. His chief opponents were the [[Stoics]] and their belief that reality could be comprehended with certainty.

==Life==
Arcesilaus was born in [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]] in [[Aeolis]]. His early education was provided by [[Autolycus of Pitane|Autolycus]] the [[mathematician]], with whom he migrated to [[Sardis]]. Afterwards, he studied [[rhetoric]] in [[Athens]]; but adopted philosophy and became a disciple first of [[Theophrastus]] and afterwards of [[Crantor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]]: ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became intimate with [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemo]] and [[Crates of Athens|Crates]], and eventually became head of the school (σχολάρχης). {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Life and work==
Archytas was born in [[Taranto|Tarentum]], [[Magna Graecia]] and was the son of Mnesagoras or Histiaeus. For a while, he was taught by [[Philolaus]], and was a teacher of mathematics to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. Archytas and Eudoxus' student was [[Menaechmus]]. As a Pythagorean, Archytas believed that only arithmetic, not geometry, could provide a basis for satisfactory proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times Oxford University Press, 1972 p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings cover many subjects –&amp;nbsp;including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], politics and government&amp;nbsp;– and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]]. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] starting from 343&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', &quot;Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history&amp;nbsp;...

Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=6}} He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle's views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.

Badiou has written about the concepts of [[being]], [[truth]], [[Event (philosophy)|event]] and the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] in a way that, he claims, is neither [[postmodern]] nor simply a repetition of [[Age of Enlightenment|modernity]]. Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations, and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for resurrecting the idea of [[communism]].

His writings, on a variety of subjects, inspired scholars working in a number of different traditions ([[Marxism]], [[semiotics]], [[structuralism]], religious criticism) and in disciplines as diverse as literary criticism, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Although Bakhtin was active in the debates on aesthetics and literature that took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s, his distinctive position did not become well known until he was rediscovered by Russian scholars in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
{{Semiotics}}
Bakhtin was born in [[Oryol]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to an old family of the nobility. His father was the manager of a bank and worked in several cities. For this reason Bakhtin spent his early childhood years in Oryol, in [[Vilnius]], and then in [[Odessa]], where in 1913 he joined the historical and philological faculty at the local university. Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist write: &quot;Odessa..., like Vilnius, was an appropriate setting for a chapter in the life of a man who was to become the philosopher of [[heteroglossia]] and [[Carnivalesque|carnival]]. The same sense of fun and irreverence that gave birth to [[Isaak Babel|Babel]]'s Rabelaisian gangster or to the tricks and deceptions of [[Ostap Bender]], the [[picaro]] created by [[Ilf and Petrov]], left its mark on Bakhtin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist, ''Mikhail Bakhtin'' (Harvard University Press, 1984: ISBN 0-674-57417-6), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to [[Petersburg University]] to join his brother Nikolai. It is here that Bakhtin was greatly influenced by the classicist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|F. F. Zelinsky]], whose works contain the beginnings of concepts elaborated by Bakhtin.

Hegel]], Bauer was a radical [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] in philosophy, politics and Biblical criticism.  Bauer investigated the sources of the [[New Testament]] and, beginning with Hegel's Hellenophile orientation, concluded that early Christianity owed more to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophy ([[Stoicism]]) than to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;see Bauer's work &quot;Christus und die Caesaren&quot; (English: ''Christ and the Caesars'')&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruno Bauer is also known by his association and sharp break with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], and by his later association with [[Max Stirner]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Starting in 1840, he began a series of works arguing that Jesus was a 2nd-century fusion of Jewish, Greek, and Roman theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]].

An eclectic thinker, combining elements of [[German idealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Western Marxism]], and [[Jewish mysticism]], Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], [[literary criticism]], and [[historical materialism]]. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kabbalah]] scholar [[Gershom Scholem]]. He was also related by law to [[Germans|German]] [[political theory|political theorist]] [[Hannah Arendt]] through her first marriage to his cousin, [[Günther Anders]]. 

Among Benjamin's best known works are the essays &quot;The Task of the Translator&quot; (1923), &quot;[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]&quot; (1936), and &quot;[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]&quot; (1940).

He also made major translations into German of the ''Tableaux Parisiens'' section of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' and parts of Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide in [[Portbou]] at the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from invading [[Nazism|Nazi forces]]. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

This theory denies the existence of [[matter|material substance]] and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only [[idea]]s in the [[mind]]s of [[perception|perceivers]], and as a result cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of [[abstraction]], an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.

'''Sir Isaiah Berlin''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|CBE|FBA}} (6 June 1909&amp;nbsp;– 5 November 1997) was a Latvian-British social and political theorist, [[philosopher]] and [[historian of ideas]], widely considered to be the dominant British scholar of his generation.&lt;ref name = bbcobit/&gt; He excelled as an essayist, conversationalist and [[raconteur]], and was a brilliant lecturer who spontaneously [[improvisation|improvised]] richly allusive and coherently structured material.&lt;ref name = bbcobit /&gt; In its obituary of the scholar, the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' stated that &quot;Isaiah Berlin was often described, especially in his old age, by means of superlatives: the world's greatest talker, the century's most inspired reader, one of the finest minds of our time... there is no doubt that he showed in more than one direction the unexpectedly large possibilities open to us at the top end of the range of human potential&quot;.&lt;ref name = independentobit /&gt;

In 1932, at the age of 23, Berlin was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He translated works by [[Ivan Turgenev]] from Russian into English and, during the war, worked for the [[British Diplomatic Service]]. From 1957 to 1967 he was [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]] at the University of Oxford. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1963 to 1964. In 1966, he played a crucial role in founding [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], and became its first President.

Berlin was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1946, [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1957, and was awarded the [[Order of Merit]] in 1971. He was President of the [[British Academy]] from 1974 to 1978. He also received the 1979 [[Jerusalem Prize]] for his writings on individual freedom.

==Works==
Blanchot's work is not a coherent, all-encompassing 'theory', since it is a work founded on [[paradox]] and impossibility.  The thread running through all his writing is the constant engagement with the 'question of literature', a simultaneous enactment and interrogation of the profoundly strange experience of writing.  For Blanchot, 'literature begins at the moment when literature becomes a question' (''Literature and the Right to Death'').&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Blanchot (1995) 'Literature and the Right to Death' in ''The Work of Fire''.

'''Ned Joel Block''' (born 1942) is an [[American philosopher]] working in the field of the [[philosophy of mind]] who has made important contributions to matters of [[consciousness]] and [[cognitive science]]. In 1971, he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] under [[Hilary Putnam]]. He went to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as an assistant professor of philosophy (1971-1977), worked as associate professor of philosophy (1977-1983), professor of philosophy (1983-1996) and served as chair of the philosophy section (1989-1995). He has, since 1996, been a professor in the departments of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] and at the Center for Neural Science at [[New York University]] (NYU).

Block is noted for presenting the [[Blockhead (computer system)|Blockhead argument]] against the [[Turing Test]] as a test of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] in a paper titled ''[http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/Psychologism.htm Psychologism and Behaviorism]'' (1981). He is also known for his criticism of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], arguing that a [[system]] with the same [[functional state]]s as a human is not necessarily conscious. In his more recent work on [[consciousness]], he has made a distinction between [[phenomenal consciousness]] and [[Phenomenal consciousness#Phenomenal and access consciousness|access consciousness]], where phenomenal consciousness consists of subjective experience and feelings and access consciousness consists of that information globally available in the cognitive system for the purposes of reasoning, speech and high-level action control. He has argued that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness might not always coincide in human beings.

Block has been a judge at the [[Loebner Prize]] contest, a contest in the tradition of the Turing Test to determine whether a conversant is a computer or a human.

He is married to the developmental psychologist [[Susan Carey]].

'''Maurice Blondel''' ({{IPA-fr|blɔ̃dɛl|lang}}; 2 November 1861 – 4 June 1949) was a French [[philosopher]], whose most influential works, notably ''L'Action'', aimed at establishing the correct relationship between autonomous philosophical reasoning and Christianity.

==Biography==
Blondel was born in [[Dijon]] in 1861. He came from a family who were traditionally connected to the legal profession, but chose early in life to follow a career in philosophy. In 1881, he gained admission to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] of [[Paris]]. In 1893 he finished his thesis &quot;L'Action&quot; (Action), a critical essay of life and of a science of the practice. He was at this time refused a teaching post (as would have been his due) because his philosophical conclusions were deemed to be too 'Christian' and, therefore, &quot;compromising&quot; of philosophical reason. In 1895, however, with the help of his former teacher Emile Boutroux, he became a ''Maître de Conférences'' at [[Lille]], then shortly after at [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he became a professor in 1897. He would remain in Aix-en-Provence for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A Conway, 'Maurice Blondel and ''Ressourcement'' ', in Gabriel Flynn and Paul D. Murray, ''Ressourcement'' (Oxford: OUP, 2012), p70.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Bodin''' (1530–1596) was a [[French people|French]] [[jurist]] and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]], member of the [[Parlement]] of [[Paris]] and professor of law in [[Toulouse]]. He is best known for his theory of [[sovereignty]]; he was also an influential writer on [[demonology]].

Bodin lived during the aftermath of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and wrote against the background of religious conflict in France. He remained a nominal Catholic throughout his life but was critical of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal authority]] over governments, favouring the strong central control of a national monarchy as an antidote to factional strife. Toward the end of his life he wrote, but did not publish, a dialogue among different religions, including representatives of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] and [[natural theology]], in which all agreed to coexist in concord.

In contemporary English, his name may be spelled '''Jacob Boehme'''; in seventeenth-century England it was also spelled '''Behmen''', approximating the contemporary English pronunciation of the German ''Böhme''.

In 1902, he became the editor of the weekly ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'', the central organ of the [[Zionist]] movement, although he later withdrew from organizational work in Zionism.  In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (later translated into English as ''I and Thou''), and in 1925, he began translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into the [[German language]].

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], but resigned from his professorship in protest immediately after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews to attend public education. In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in [[Jerusalem]], [[British Mandate for Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], receiving a professorship at [[Hebrew University]] and lecturing in [[anthropology]] and introductory [[sociology]].

Buber was a direct descendent of the prominent 16th century rabbi [[Meir ben Isaac Katzenellenbogen|Meir Katzenellenbogen]], known as the Maharam of [[Padua]], as was his cousin, cosmetics entrepreneur [[Helena Rubinstein]]. [[Karl Marx]] is another notable relative.&lt;ref name=&quot;unbroken&quot; /&gt;

'''Joseph Butler''' (18 May 1692 – 16 June 1752) was an [[English (people)|English]] [[bishop]], [[Christian theology|theologian]], [[apologist]], and [[philosopher]]. He was born in [[Wantage]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]] (now [[Oxfordshire]]). He is known, among other things, for his critique of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[John Locke]]'s theory of [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Butler (1692—1752)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/butler/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his life and after his death, Butler influenced many philosophers, including [[David Hume]], [[Thomas Reid]], and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;White (2006), §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
The son of a [[Presbyterian]] linen-draper, he was destined for the ministry of that church and, along with future archbishop [[Thomas Secker]], entered [[Samuel Jones (academy tutor)|Samuel Jones]]'s dissenting academy at Gloucester (later Tewkesbury) for that purpose. Whilst there, he entered into a secret correspondence with the conformist controversialist [[Samuel Clarke]]; his letters were taken to Gloucester post office by Secker, who also collected Clarke's responses from there. Clarke later published this correspondence. In 1714, he decided to enter the [[Church of England]], and went to [[Oriel College]], [[Oxford]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1718 and later proceeded [[Doctor of Civil Law]] on 8 December 1733.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Church career==
Butler was ordained a deacon on 26 October 1718 by [[William Talbot (bishop)|William Talbot]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], in his Bishop's Palace, Salisbury, his palace chapel&lt;ref&gt;{{CCEd |type=ordination |id=26955 |name=Butler, Joseph |accessed=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a priest on 21 December by Talbot at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; After holding various other high positions, he became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the rich living of [[Stanhope, County Durham]].

In 1736 he was made the head chaplain of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s wife [[Caroline of Ansbach|Caroline]], on the advice of [[Lancelot Blackburne]]. He was nominated [[Bishop of Bristol]] on 19 October 1738 and consecrated a bishop on 3 December 1738 at [[Lambeth Palace]] chapel. Remaining Bishop of Bristol, Butler was installed [[Dean of St Paul's]] on 24 May 1740; he kept that office until his translation to Durham.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; He is said (apocryphally) to have declined an offer to become the [[archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1747. He was translated to Durham by the [[Confirmation of bishops|confirmation]] of his [[Canonical election|election]] to that See in October 1750; he was then enthroned by proxy on 9 November 1750.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Works==
He is most famous for his ''Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel'' (1726) and ''Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed'' (1736). The ''Analogy'' is an important work of Christian [[apologetics]] in the history of the controversies over [[deism]]'s apologetic concentrated on &quot;the general analogy between the principles of divine government, as set forth by the biblical revelation, and those observable in the course of nature, [an analogy which] leads us to the warrantable conclusion that there is one Author of both.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Butler, Joseph.&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler's arguments combined a cumulative case for faith using probabilistic reasoning to persuade deists and others to reconsider orthodox faith. Overall, his two books are remarkable and original contributions to ethics and [[theology]].  They depend for their effect entirely upon the force of their reasoning, for they have no graces of style.

'''Albert Camus''' ({{IPA-fr|albɛʁ kamy|lang|Albert Camus.ogg}}; 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, and journalist. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He wrote in his essay ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of [[nihilism]] while still delving deeply into individual freedom.

He was a major member of the [[Vienna Circle]] and an [[advocate]] of [[logical positivism]].  He is considered &quot;one of the giants among twentieth-century philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00004&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:Wuppertal Ronsdorf - Villa Carnap 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Carnap's Birthplace in Wuppertal]]
Carnap's father had risen from the status of a poor ribbon-weaver to become the owner of a ribbon-making factory. His mother came from academic stock; her father was an educational reformer and her oldest brother was the archaeologist [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]]. As a ten-year-old, Carnap accompanied his uncle on an expedition to Greece.&lt;ref name=DCDVlife&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine, W.V. and Rudolf Carnap|title=Dear Carnap, Dear Van: The Quine-Carnap Correspondence and Related Work|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carneades''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑr|ˈ|n|iː|ə|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Καρνεάδης, ''Karneadēs''}}, &quot;of [[Carnea]]&quot;; 214/3–129/8 BC&lt;ref&gt;Tiziano Dorandi, ''Chapter 2: Chronology'', in Algra et al. (1999) ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', page 48. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Academic skepticism|Academic skeptic]] born in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. By the year 159 BC, he had started to refute all previous dogmatic doctrines, especially [[Stoicism]], and even the [[Epicurean]]s whom previous skeptics had spared. As head of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]], he was one of three philosophers sent to [[Rome]] in 155 BC where his lectures on the uncertainty of [[justice]] caused consternation among the leading politicians. He left no writings and many of his opinions are known only via his successor [[Clitomachus (philosopher)|Clitomachus]]. He seems to have doubted the ability, not just of the [[senses]] but of [[reason]] too, in acquiring [[truth]]. His skepticism was, however, moderated by the belief that we can, nevertheless, ascertain probabilities of truth, to enable us to live and act correctly.

==Life==
Carneades, the son of Epicomus or Philocomiis, was born at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[North Africa]] in 214/213 BC. He migrated early to [[Athens]], and attended the lectures of the [[Stoics]], and learned their logic from [[Diogenes of Babylon|Diogenes]]. He studied the works of [[Chrysippus]], and exerted his energy of a very acute and original mind in their refutation.

==Life==
Stanley Cavell was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. His mother, a locally renowned pianist, trained him in music from his earliest days. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 21 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; During the Depression, Cavell’s parents moved several times between Atlanta and [[Sacramento, California]]. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 24 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Cavell played lead [[alto saxophone]] as the youngest and sole white member of a black jazz band in Sacramento. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 169 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  At 16, he entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he majored in music, studying with, among others, [[Roger Sessions]] and [[Ernest Bloch]]. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 85, 183  (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he began studies in composition at the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in [[New York City]], only to discover that music was no longer his aspiration. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 220-225 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually began to study philosophy at [[UCLA]], and then transferred as a graduate student to Harvard University. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 247 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a student there he came under the influence of the visiting [[J. L. Austin]], whose teaching and methods &quot;knocked him off ... [his] horse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality and Tragedy, xv (New York: Oxford, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 he was awarded a Junior Fellowship at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]]. Before completing his PhD, he became an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 326 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962-1963 Cavell was a Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he became a lifelong friend of the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]]. &lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 149 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he returned to the Harvard Philosophy Department, where he became the Walter M.

'''Paul Churchland''' (born October 21, 1942) is a Canadian philosopher noted for his studies in [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In more recent history, eliminative materialism has received attention from a broader range of writers, including many concerned not only with the metaphysics of the mind, but also the process of theory change, the status of semantic properties, the nature of psychological explanation and recent developments in cognitive science. Much of this attention has been fostered by the husband-wife team of Paul and Patricia Churchland, whose writings have forced many philosophers and cognitive scientists to take eliminativism more seriously.&quot; - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eliminative Materialism: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/#BriHis&lt;/ref&gt; He is Professor Emeritus at the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he held the Valtz Chair of Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;See: http://philosophy.ucsd.edu/fac/fac.html&lt;/ref&gt; and a joint appointment with the Cognitive Science Faculty and the [[Institute for Neural Computation]].&lt;ref&gt;See the UCSD Cognitive Science Inter-Disciplinary Faculty: http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/index.php?cat=grads&amp;page=inter_phd-people&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1969 under the direction of [[Wilfrid Sellars]].&lt;ref&gt;See: http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/churchlandpm.html&lt;/ref&gt; Churchland is the husband of philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]], and it has been noted that, &quot;Their work is so similar that they are sometimes discussed, in journals and books, as one person.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/12/two-heads&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the father of two children, Mark and Anne Churchland, both of whom are neuroscientists.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://philosophy.ucsd.edu/faculty/pchurchland/cv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cshl.edu/gradschool/research-faculty/churchland-anne Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | Anne Churchland].

'''Cleanthes''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|i|ˈ|æ|n|θ|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Κλεάνθης}} ''Kleanthēs''; c. 330 BC – c. 230 BC), of [[Assos]], was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] and successor to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], as the second head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the Stoic school in [[Athens]]. Originally a [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxer]], he came to Athens where he took up philosophy, listening to Zeno's lectures. He supported himself by working as water-carrier at night. After the death of Zeno, c. 262 BC, he became the head of the school, a post he held for the next 32 years. Cleanthes successfully preserved and developed Zeno's doctrines. He originated new ideas in [[Stoic physics]], and developed Stoicism in accordance with the principles of [[materialism]] and [[pantheism]]. Among the fragments of Cleanthes' writings which have come down to us, the largest is a ''Hymn to Zeus''. His pupil was [[Chrysippus]] who became one of the most important Stoic thinkers.

==Life==
Cleanthes was born in [[Assos]] in the [[Troad]] about 330 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;age1&quot;&gt;According to [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] as quoted by [[Philodemus]], Cleanthes was born in Aristophanes' archonship (331/0 BC) and died in Jason's Archonship (230/29 BC). [[Pseudo-Lucian]], [[Valerius Maximus]], and [[Censorinus]] say that Cleanthes lived to the age of 99 (although [[Diogenes Laërtius]] says he died at the age of 80.)  For more information see Tiziano Dorandi, ''Chapter 2: Chronology'', in Algra et al. (1999) ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', page 38. Cambridge. Dorandi prefers an age of 101.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;diog1&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/diogeneslaertius-book7-stoics.html ''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'', vii].&lt;/ref&gt; he was the son of Phanias, and early in life he was a [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxer]].  With but four [[drachma]]e in his possession he came to [[Athens]], where he took up philosophy, listening first to the lectures of [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]] the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]],&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Cleanthes''&lt;/ref&gt; and then to those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], the Stoic. In order to support himself, he worked all night as water-carrier to a gardener (hence his nickname ''the Well-Water-Collector'', {{lang-el|Φρεάντλης}}).  As he spent the whole day in studying philosophy with no visible means of support, he was summoned before the [[Areopagus]] to account for his way of living. The judges were so delighted by the evidence of work which he produced, that they voted him ten [[mina (unit)|minae]], though Zeno would not permit him to accept them. His power of patient endurance, or perhaps his slowness, earned him the title of &quot;''the Ass''&quot; from his fellow students, a name which he was said to have rejoiced in, as it implied that his back was strong enough to bear whatever Zeno put upon it.

'''Isidore Auguste Marie François Xavier Comte''' (19 January 1798 – 5 September 1857), better known as '''Auguste Comte''' ({{IPA-fr|oɡyst kɔ̃t|lang}}), was a French philosopher. He was a founder of the discipline of [[sociology]] and of the [[doctrine]] of [[positivism]]. He is sometimes regarded as the first [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Con&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the [[utopian socialist]] [[Henri Saint-Simon]], Comte developed the ''positive philosophy'' in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the [[French Revolution]], calling for a new social doctrine based on the [[sciences]]. Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture25a.html#course&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''sociologie'' and  [[social evolutionism]] set the tone for early [[social theorist]]s and [[anthropologist]]s such as [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], evolving into modern academic sociology presented by [[Émile Durkheim]] as practical and objective [[social research]].

Comte's social theories culminated in the &quot;[[Religion of Humanity]]&quot;, which influenced the development of [[Religious humanism|religious humanist]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]] organizations in the 19th century. Comte likewise coined the word ''altruisme'' ([[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Corbin''' (14 April 1903 – 7 October 1978) was a [[philosopher]], [[theologian]] and professor of [[Islamic studies|Islamic Studies]] at the École pratique des hautes études in [[Paris]], France.

Corbin was born in Paris in April 1903. Although he was [[Protestant]] by birth, he was educated in the [[Catholic]] tradition and at the age of 19 received a certificate in [[Scholastic philosophy]] from the [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Catholic Institute of Paris]]. Three years later he took his &quot;licence de philosophie&quot; under the [[Thomist]] [[Étienne Gilson]]. In 1928 he encountered [[Louis Massignon]], director of Islamic studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and it was he who introduced Corbin to the writings of [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]], the 12th century [[Iran|Persian]] [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[philosopher]] whose work was to profoundly affect the course of Corbin's life. Years later Corbin said &quot;through my meeting with Suhrawardi, my spiritual destiny for the passage through this world was sealed. [[Platonic realism|Platonism]], expressed in terms of the [[Zoroastrian]] [[angelology]] of ancient [[Persia]], illuminated the path that I was seeking.&quot;

'''Benedetto Croce''' ({{IPA-it|beneˈdetto ˈkroːtʃe|lang}}; 25 February 1866&amp;nbsp;– 20 November 1952) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[idealist philosophy|idealist]] [[philosopher]], historian and occasionally also [[politician]]. He wrote on numerous topics, including [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[historiography]] and [[aesthetics]]. He was a [[Liberalism|liberal]], although he opposed [[laissez-faire]] [[free trade]], and had considerable influence on other Italian intellectuals including both Marxist [[Antonio Gramsci]] and fascist [[Giovanni Gentile]].
He was President of [[PEN International]], the worldwide writers' association, from 1949 until 1952.

==Biography==
Croce was born in [[Pescasseroli]] in the [[Abruzzo]] region of Italy. His family was influential and wealthy, and he was raised in a very strict Catholic environment. Around the age of 16, he quit Catholicism and developed a personal philosophy of spiritual life, in which religion cannot be anything but an historical institution where the creative strength of mankind can be expressed. He kept this philosophy for the rest of his life.

'''Joseph-Marie, [[Count|comte]] de Maistre''' ({{IPA-fr|də mɛstʁ|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maistre&quot; is traditionally pronounced {{IPA-fr|mɛstʁ|}} (i.e. sounding the &quot;s&quot; and rhyming with ''[[wikt:bourgmestre|bourgmestre]]''); that is how it is usually heard at university and in historical movies (e.g. in [[Sacha Guitry]]'s 1948 film {{link-interwiki|vertical-align=sup|en=Le Diable boiteux (film)|en_text=''Le Diable Boiteux''|lang=fr|lang_title=Le Diable Boiteux (film)}}). The pronunciation {{IPA-fr|mɛtʁ|}} (rhymes with ''[[wikt:maître|maître]]'') is sometimes heard, under the influence of the modernized pronunciation adopted by some descendants (such as {{link-interwiki|vertical-align=sup|en=Patrice de Maistre|lang=fr|lang_title=Patrice de Maistre}}).&lt;/ref&gt; 1 April 1753 – 26 February 1821) was a [[Savoy]]ard philosopher, writer, lawyer, and diplomat. He defended [[Social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies and a [[Monarchy|monarchical State]] in the period immediately following the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Beum, Robert (1997). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/ModernAge-1997q3-00290 &quot;Ultra-Royalism Revisited,&quot;] ''Modern Age'', Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Maistre was a subject of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|King of Piedmont-Sardinia]], whom he served as member of the Savoy Senate (1787–1792), ambassador to Russia (1803–1817),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dublinreview33londuoft#page/418/mode/2up &quot;Joseph de Maistre,&quot;] ''The Dublin Review'', Vol. XXXIII, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; and minister of state to the court in [[Turin]] (1817–1821).&lt;ref&gt;The issue of Maistre's national identity has long been contentious. In 1802, after the invasion of Savoy and [[Piedmont]] by the armies of the [[French First Republic]], Maistre had fled in [[Cagliari]], the ancient capital of Kingdom of Sardinia that resisted to the French invasion, wrote to the French ambassador in [[Naples]], objecting to having been classified as a French ''[[émigré]]'' and thus subject to confiscation of his properties and punishment should he attempt to return to Savoy. According to the biographical notice written by his son Rodolphe and included in the ''Complete Works'', on that occasion Maistre wrote that {{quote|He had not been born French, and did not desire to become French, and that, never having set foot in the lands conquered by France, he could not have become French.|''Œuvres complètes de Joseph de Maistre'', Lyon, 1884, vol. I, p. XVIII.}}  Sources such as the [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358824/Joseph-de-Maistre ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''] and the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09554a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia''] identify Maistre as French, by culture if not by law. In 1860 Albert Blanc, professor of law at the [[University of Turin]], in his preface to a collection of Maistre's diplomatic correspondence wrote that: {{quote|... this philosopher [Maistre] was a politician; this Catholic was an Italian; he foretold the destiny of the [[House of Savoy]], he supported the end of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Austrian rule]] [of northern Italy], he has been, during this century, one of the first defenders of [Italian] independence.|''Correspondance diplomatique de Joseph de Maistre'', Paris, 1860, vol. I, pp. III-IV.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maistre, a key figure of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Masseau, Didier (2000). ''Les Ennemis des Philosophes.'' Editions Albin Michel.&lt;/ref&gt; saw monarchy both as a [[Divine right of kings|divinely sanctioned institution]] and as the only stable form of government.&lt;ref&gt;Alibert, Jacques (1992). ''Joseph de Maistre, Etat et Religion.'' Paris: Perrin.&lt;/ref&gt; He called for the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]] to the throne of France and argued that the [[Pope]] should have ultimate authority in temporal matters. Maistre also claimed that it was the [[rationalism|rationalist]] rejection of [[Christianity]] which was directly responsible for the disorder and bloodshed which followed the French Revolution of 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun, Richard (1989). &quot;The Satanic Revolution: Joseph de Maistre's Religious Judgment of the French Revolution&quot;, ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Western Society for French History'', Vol. 16, pp. 234–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrard, Graeme (1996). &quot;Joseph de Maistre's Civilization and its Discontents,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 57, No. 3, pp. 429–446.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles Deleuze''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒil dəløz|lang}}; 18 January 1925&amp;nbsp;– 4 November 1995) was a French [[philosopher]] who, from the early 1960s until his death, wrote influentially on [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[film]], and [[fine art]]. His most popular works were the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'': ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]].  His metaphysical treatise ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his [[magnum opus]].&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilles Deleuze|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 February 2011}} See also: &quot;''Difference and Repetition'' is definitely the most important work published by Deleuze.&quot; (Edouard Morot-Sir, from the back cover of the first edition of the English translation), or James Williams' judgment: &quot;It is nothing less than a revolution in philosophy and stands out as one of the great philosophical works of the twentieth century&quot; (Williams, ''Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Critical Introduction and Guide'' [Edinburgh UP, 2003], p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.

'''Giorgio Del Vecchio''' (Bologna, 1878 – Genoa 1970) was a prominent [[Italy|Italian]] [[legal philosopher]] of the early 20th century. Among others he influenced the theories of [[Norberto Bobbio]]. He is famous for his book ''Justice''.

== Biography ==
Son of Julius Saviour, Giorgio Del Vecchio was professor of philosophy of law at the University of Ferrara (1904), Sassari (1906), Messina (1909), Bologna (1911) and Rome from 1920 to 1953. He became Rector of the University of Rome from 1925 to 1927. He initially adhered to Fascism like many philosophers of law in Italy (though he removed himself from fascist ideology early on). He lost his professorship twice and for opposite reasons: in 1938 at the hands of fascists because he was a Jew and in 1944 at the hands of anti-fascists because he was accused of sympathizing with fascism early on in his career.

Reinstated in teaching during the Second World War, he worked with the ''Century of Italy'' and the magazine ''Free Pages'' (publication directed by Vito Panucci). Along with Nino Tripodi, Gioacchino Volpe, Alberto Asquini, Roberto Cantalupo, Ernesto De Marzio and Emilio Betti, he was part of the organizing committee of INSPE, an Institute of research which in the fifties and sixties was opposed to Marxist culture, promoting international conferences and publications. He was founder and director of the ''International Journal of Philosophy of Law''.

He is considered among the major interpreters of Italian Neo-Kantism. Giorgio Del Vecchio, as did his German colleagues, criticized  philosophical positivism, stating that the concept of law can not be derived from the observation of legal phenomena.

Dewey is one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of [[pragmatism]] and is considered one of the founders of [[functional psychology]].

'''Denis Diderot''' ({{IPA-fr|dəni did(ə)ʁo|lang}}; 5 October 1713 – 31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, [[art critic]], and writer. He was a prominent figure during the [[Age of the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' along with [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

Diderot's literary reputation during his lifetime rested primarily on his plays and his contributions to the ''Encyclopédie''; many of his most important works, including ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]], [[Rameau's Nephew]]'', and ''[[Le Rêve de d’Alembert|D'Alembert's Dream]]'', were published only after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Hampson.

Born to Frederick and Hattie Dretske, he first planned to be an engineer, attending [[Purdue University]]. He changed his mind after taking the university's only philosophy course, deciding philosophy was the only thing he wanted to do in his life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/fred-dretske&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 1954 with a degree in electrical engineering and serving in the Army, he enrolled in graduate school in philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he received his PhD in 1960. His dissertation, supervised by May Brodbeck, was on the philosophy of time.

Dretske’s first academic appointment was to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1960, where he rose to the rank of full Professor. In 1988 he was recruited to [[Stanford University]], where he was the Bella and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor of Philosophy. He remained at Stanford until his retirement in 1998, after which he was Professor Emeritus in Philosophy at Stanford and Senior Research Scholar in Philosophy at [[Duke University]] until his death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/fred-dretske&lt;/ref&gt;

Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 1861 – 14 September 1916) was a [[France|French]] [[physics|physicist]], [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[history of science|historian]] and [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], best known for his writings on the indeterminacy of experimental criteria and on scientific development in the [[Middle Ages]]. Duhem also made major contributions to the science of his day, particularly in the fields of [[hydrodynamics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], and [[thermodynamics]].

==Philosophy==
Duhem's views on the philosophy of science are explicated in his 1906 work ''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''.&lt;ref name=aim&gt;{{cite book|last=Duhem|first=Pierre|author2=Philip P. Wiener|others=Jules Vuillemin|trans_title=The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory|title=La Théorie Physique: son Objet et sa Structure|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1954|isbn=978-0-691-02524-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he opposed [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s statement that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'s'' [[Newton's Law of Gravity|law of universal mutual gravitation]] was [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] from '[[phenomena]]', including [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s second and third laws. Newton's claims in this regard had already been attacked by critical proof-analyses of the German logician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and then most famously by [[Immanuel Kant]], following [[David Hume|Hume]]'s logical critique of [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. But the novelty of Duhem's work was his proposal that Newton's theory of universal mutual gravity flatly ''contradicted'' Kepler's Laws of planetary motion because the interplanetary mutual gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s caused deviations from Keplerian [[orbit]]s. Since no [[proposition]] can be [[validity|validly]] logically deduced from any it contradicts, according to Duhem, Newton must not have logically deduced his law of gravitation directly from Kepler's Laws.&lt;ref name=aim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=Paul Feyerabend |author3=Matteo Motterlini |title=For and Against Method: Including Lakatos's Lectures on Scientific Method and the Lakatos-Feyerabend Correspondence|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|pages=45–49|isbn=978-0-226-46774-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=John Worrall |author3=Gregory Currie |title=The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|chapter=5: Newton's Effect on Scientific Standards|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=John Worrall |author3=Gregory Currie |title=Mathematics, Science, and Epistemology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1978|chapter=5: The Method of Analysis-Synthesis|isbn=978-0-521-21769-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Waldo Emerson ''' (May 25, 1803&amp;nbsp;– April 27, 1882) was an American [[essayist]], [[lecturer]], and [[poet]] who led the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of [[individualism]] and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States.

'''Empedocles''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|m|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|k|l|iː|z|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἐμπεδοκλῆς}} {{IPA-grc|empedoklɛ̂ːs|}}, ''Empedoklēs''; c. 490 – c. 430 BC) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]] and a citizen of [[Agrigento|Agrigentum]], a Greek city in [[Sicily]]. Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the originator of the [[Cosmogony|cosmogenic]] theory of the four [[Classical elements]]. He also proposed powers called Love and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements. These physical speculations were part of a history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life. Influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]], he supported the doctrine of [[reincarnation]]. Empedocles is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to record his ideas in verse. Some of his work survives, more than in the case of any other Presocratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.

His teachings were written down and published by his pupil [[Arrian]] in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]''.

Epictetus taught that [[philosophy]] is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are determined by [[Destiny|fate]], and are thus beyond our control; we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline.

Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus's 300 written works remain. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators.

For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ''[[ataraxia]]''—peace and freedom from fear—and ''[[aponia]]''—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that pleasure and pain are measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of [[atomism|atoms]] moving in empty space.

Born in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[German Empire|Germany]], he was arrested by [[Nazism|Nazis]] on the night of 9 November 1938, known as [[Kristallnacht]]. Briefly interned at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] (1938–1939), he escaped with his younger brother Wolfgang&lt;ref name=&quot;gedenkbuch.halle.de&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gedenkbuch.halle.de/gbdatensatz.php?num=119 |title=Unser Gedenkbuch für die Toten des Holocaust in Halle |publisher=Gedenkbuch.halle.de |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Great Britain]], where his parents later joined him.

'''Paul Karl Feyerabend''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfaɪɐˌaːbɛnt|lang}}; January 13, 1924 – February 11, 1994) was an [[Austria]]n-born [[philosopher of science]] best known for his work as a professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he worked for three decades (1958–1989). At various different points in his life, he lived in England, the United States, [[New Zealand]], [[Italy]], Germany, and finally [[Switzerland]]. His major works include ''[[Against Method]]'' (published in 1975), ''[[Science in a Free Society]]'' (published in 1978) and ''Farewell to Reason'' (a collection of papers published in 1987). Feyerabend became famous for his purportedly [[epistemological anarchism|anarchistic view of science]] and his rejection of the existence of universal methodological rules.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, J. (1993) ''Profile: Paul Karl Feyerabend – The Worst Enemy of Science'', [[Scientific American]] '''268'''(5), 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; He is an influential figure in the [[philosophy of science]], and also in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].

'''Jerry Alan Fodor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|oʊ|d|ər}}; born 1935) is an [[American philosopher]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientist]]. He holds the position of [[State of New Jersey]] Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at [[Rutgers University]] and is the author of many works in the fields of [[philosophy of mind]] and cognitive science, in which he has laid the groundwork for the [[modularity of mind]] and the [[language of thought]] hypotheses, among other ideas. He is known for his provocative and sometimes [[polemic]]al style of argumentation and as &quot;one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960, Fodor’s work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/fodor/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fodor argues that mental states, such as [[belief]]s and [[desire (philosophy)|desires]], are relations between individuals and [[Representational theory of mind|mental representations]]. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a [[language of thought]] (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.

For Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of [[modularity of the mind|modules]], or &quot;organs&quot;, which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the &quot;central processing&quot; part of the mind, which has a more global and less &quot;domain specific&quot; character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fuʁje|lang}}; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French [[philosopher]] and an influential early [[socialist]] thinker later associated with &quot;[[utopian socialism]]&quot;. Some of Fourier's social and moral views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream thinking in modern society. Fourier is, for instance, credited with having originated the word ''[[feminism]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGoldstein1982|Goldstein 1982]], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's social views and proposals inspired a whole movement of [[intentional communities]]. Among them in the United States were the community of [[Utopia, Ohio]]; [[La Reunion (Dallas)|La Reunion]] near present-day [[Dallas, Texas]]; the [[North American Phalanx]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], [[New Jersey]]; [[Brook Farm]] in [[West Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]] (where [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] was one of the founders); the [[Community Place]] and [[Alasa Farms|Sodus Bay Phalanx]] in New York State, and several others. Later Fourier inspired a diverse array of revolutionary thinkers and writers.

==Early life==

Peter Geach was born in [[London]] in 1916 to George Hender Geach, a professor of philosophy in Lahore and Cambridge, and [[E. F. A. Geach|Eleonora Adolfina Sgonina]], a poet, and spent his earliest years in [[Cardiff]].  He attended [[The Cathedral School, Llandaff|Llandaff Cathedral School]] and [[Clifton College]].  He received instruction in logic and philosophy from his father who, as a member of the Indian Educational Service, had been Professor of Philosophy at Lahore and later Principal of a teacher training college in Peshawar.  His parents' marriage was unhappy and quickly broke up. Until around the age of eight, Peter lived with his maternal grandparents in Cardiff, after which time he was sent off to school by his father and raised by a guardian. Geach never saw his mother again after childhood.

In 1934 Geach won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], graduating in 1938 with a First in Literae Humaniores.

'''Giovanni Gentile''' ({{IPA-it|dʒoˈvanni dʒenˈtiːle|lang}}; May 30, 1875 – April 15, 1944) was an Italian neo-[[Hegelian]] [[Idealist]] philosopher and politician, a peer of [[Benedetto Croce]]. He described himself as 'the philosopher of [[Fascism]]', and [[ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] ''[[Doctrine of Fascism|A Doctrine of Fascism]]'' (1932) for [[Benito Mussolini]]. He also devised his own system of philosophy, [[Actual Idealism]].

== Life and thought ==

Giovanni Gentile was born in [[Castelvetrano]], [[Sicily]]. He was inspired by Italian intellectuals such as [[Mazzini]], [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini]], [[Vincenzo Gioberti|Gioberti]], and Spaventa from whom he borrowed the idea of ''autoctisi'', &quot;self-construction&quot;, but also was strongly influenced by the German idealist and materialist schools of thought — namely [[Karl Marx]], [[Hegel]], and [[Fichte]] with whom he shared the ideal of creating a ''[[Wissenschaftslehre]]'', theory for a structure of knowledge that makes no assumptions. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], too, influenced him, as seen in an analogy between Nietzsche's ''Übermensch'' and Gentile's ''Uomo Fascista''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In Religione he presents himself as a Catholic (of sorts), and emphasises [[actual idealism]]'s Christian heritage, Antonio G. Pesce insists that 'there is in fact no doubt that Gentile was a Catholic', but he occasionally identifies himself as an atheist, albeit one who is still ''culturally'' a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=KPHyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289&amp;lpg=PT289&amp;dq=Le+ragioni+del+mio+ateismo+e+la+storia+del+cristianesimo,+Giornale+critico+della+filosofia+italiana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qlbWtGMJCA&amp;sig=xdi2vKzQBypGcnnxswHgfU5YgCU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju_YzG-KrJAhVY1mMKHYFFCAkQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=atheist&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Gentile, ''Le ragioni del mio ateismo e la storia del cristianesimo'', Giornale critico della filosofia italiana, n. 3, 1922, pp. 325-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Étienne Gilson''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒilsɔ̃|lang}}; 13 June 1884 – 19 September 1978) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[historian of philosophy]]. A scholar of medieval philosophy, he originally specialised in the thought of Descartes, yet also philosophized in the tradition of [[Thomas Aquinas]], although he did not consider himself either a neo-Scholastic or neo-Thomist philosopher. In 1946 he attained the distinction of being elected an &quot;Immortal&quot; (member) of the [[Académie française]].

==Biography==
Born in Paris into a [[Roman Catholic]] family originally from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Gilson attended the [[minor seminary]] at Notre-Dame-des-Champs, then finished his secondary education at the [[Lycée Henri IV]]. After finishing his military service, during which he began to read [[René Descartes]], he studied for his ''[[Licentiate|licence]]'' (bachelor's degree), focusing on the influence of [[scholasticism]] on Cartesian thought. After studying at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] under [[Victor Delbos]] (1862–1916) and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] and at the [[Collège de France]] under [[Henri Bergson]], he finished his degree in Philosophy in 1906. In 1908 he married Thérèse Ravisé of Melun, and he taught in the high schools of [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], [[Tours]], [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] and [[Angers]].

In 1913, while employed in teaching at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]], he defended his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Paris]] on &quot;Liberty in Descartes and Theology&quot;. His career was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]], as he was drafted into the army as a sergeant. He served on the front and took part in the [[battle of Verdun]] as second lieutenant. He was captured in February 1916 and spent two years in captivity. During this time he devoted himself to new areas of study, including the [[Russian language]] and [[St. Bonaventure]]. He was later awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for bravery in action.

Along with [[Protagoras]], he forms the first generation of [[Sophism|Sophists]]. Several [[doxography|doxographers]] report that he was a pupil of [[Empedocles]], although he would only have been a few years younger. &quot;Like other Sophists he was an itinerant, practicing in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to invite miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guthrie&quot;&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''The Sophists'' (New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1971), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes called &quot;Gorgias the [[Nihilism|Nihilist]]&quot; although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=%22Gorgias+the+Nihilist%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y7THVOyXLIfEgwTg44OYDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg|title=A dictionary of philosophy in the words of philosophers |author=J.

His chief claim to recognition is that he transplanted rhetoric from his native Sicily to [[Attica]], and contributed to the diffusion of the [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]] as the language of literary prose.

'''Antonio Gramsci''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo ˈɡramʃi|lang}} {{Audio|It-Antonio Gramsci.ogg|listen}}; 22 January 1891 – 27 April 1937) was an Italian [[Marxist]] theoretician and politician. He wrote on [[political theory]], [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]]. He was a founding member and one-time leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]] and was imprisoned by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Fascist regime. Gramsci is best known for his theory of [[cultural hegemony]], which describes how states use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies.

'''Hugo Grotius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|oʊ|ʃ|i|ə|s}}; 10 April 1583&amp;nbsp;– 28 August 1645), also known as '''Huig de Groot''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦœyɣ də ɣroːt|lang}}) or '''Hugo de Groot''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦyɣoː də ɣroːt|lang}}), was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[jurist]]. Along with the earlier works of [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Alberico Gentili]], Grotius laid the foundations for [[international law]], based on [[natural law]]. A teenage intellectual prodigy, for his involvement in the intra-Calvinist disputes of the Dutch Republic, he was imprisoned and then escaped hidden appropriately in a chest of books. He wrote most of his major works in exile in [[France]].

It is thought that Hugo Grotius was not the first to formulate the international society doctrine, but he was one of the first to define expressly the idea of one society of states, governed not by [[force]] or [[warfare]] but by actual laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As [[Hedley Bull]] (''Hugo Grotius and International Relations'', 1992) declared: &quot;The idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the [[Peace of Westphalia]], and Grotius may be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times.&quot;

Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, [[political emancipation|emancipation]], and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of [[modernity]], particularly with respect to the discussions of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] originally set forth by [[Max Weber]]. He has been influenced by [[American pragmatism]], [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]], and even [[poststructuralism]].

Jürgen Habermas is also the father of [[Rebekka Habermas]], historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history in Göttingen.

'''Johann Georg Hamann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaːman|lang}}; 27 August 1730 – 21 June 1788) was a German philosopher, whose work was used by his student [[Johann Gottfried Herder|J. G. Herder]] as a main support of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, and associated by historian of ideas  [[Isaiah Berlin]] with the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. However, recent scholarship such as that by theologian [[Oswald Bayer]] places Hamann into a more nebulous category of theologian and philologist; he views him as less the proto-Romantic that Herder presented, and more a premodern-postmodern thinker who brought the consequences of Lutheran theology to bear upon the burgeoning Enlightenment and especially in reaction to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Oswald. A Contemporary in Dissent: Johann Georg Hamann as a Radical Enlightener. Roy A. Harrisville &amp; Mark C. Mattes, trans. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] were among those who considered him to be the finest mind of his time.

==Biography==
[[Image:Johann Georg Hamann.jpg|thumb|Johann Georg Hamann (20th century drawing)]]
Hamann was born on 27 August 1730 in [[Königsberg]]. He was destined for the pulpit, but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to intense study. His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Meineke: „Die Vortheile unserer Vereinigung“: Hamanns Dangeuil-Beylage im Lichte der Debatte um den handeltreibenden Adel. [In German] In: [http://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110290721/9783110290721.46/9783110290721.46.xml Beetz, Manfred / Rudolph, Andre (Ed.). Johann Georg Hamann: Religion und Gesellschaft (2012)''], p. 46-64.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of “the Magus of the North” ({{lang-de|Magus im Norden}}). His translation of [[David Hume]] into German is considered by most scholars as the one that Hamann's friend, Immanuel Kant, had read and referred to as inspiration for awakening from &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot;. Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a physics textbook for children.

'''Sir Stuart Newton Hampshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|ʃ|ɪər}}; 1 October 1914 – 13 June 2004) was an [[Oxford University]] [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]] and university administrator.&lt;ref&gt;Jane O'Grady, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1239568,00.html Obituary: Sir Stuart Hampshire], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the [[rationalism|antirationalist]] Oxford thinkers who gave a new direction to moral and political thought in the post-[[World War II]] era.

Hampshire was born in [[Healing, Lincolnshire]], the son of George Newton Hampshire - a fish merchant in nearby [[Grimsby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=94197|title=Hampshire, Sir Stuart Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hampshire was educated at [[Repton School]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he matriculated as a [[history]] scholar. He did not confine himself to history, switching to the study of [[literae humaniores|Greats]] and immersing himself in the study of [[painting]] and literature. As was the culture at Balliol, his intellectual development owed more to his gifted contemporaries than to academic tutors. Having taken a first class degree, in 1936 he was elected to a Fellowship of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where he researched and taught [[philosophy]] initially as an adherent of [[logical positivism]]. He participated in an informal discussion group with some of the leading philosophers of his day, including [[J. L. Austin]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]].

'''Alastair Hannay''' (born 1932) is Professor emeritus at the University of Oslo. Educated in Edinburgh and London, he continues the Scottish tradition of subjective idealism. In ''Mental Images'' (1971) he argues that visual images, like physical portraits, resemble visible objects. As a kind of sensation a mental image has material properties of its own which allow it to picture. He thus contradicts [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. Hannay has translated [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and written an intellectual biography and a monograph about his philosophy. Under Hannay's direction (managing editor 1962-71, editor 1971-2002), ''Inquiry'' grew into a widely read philosophical journal. In ''Human Consciousness'' (1990), Hannay reviews contemporary theories of human consciousness while maintaining a characteristic conservatism. Hannay argues that consciousness and the first-person point of view cannot be analysed or displaced by scientific materialism, nor can they be explained functionally, a view close to that of [[Thomas Reid]], [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], and Ferrier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop05|Hope 2005]]. p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandra G. Harding''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] philosopher of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist]] and [[post-colonialism|postcolonial theory]], [[epistemology]], research methodology, and [[philosophy of science]]. She taught for two decades at the [[University of Delaware]] before moving to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1996.  She directed the [[UCLA Center for the Study of Women]] from 1996 to 2000, and co-edited ''[[Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]'' from 2000 to 2005.  She is currently a Distinguished Professor of Education [http://gseis.ucla.edu/people/sharding] and Gender Studies [http://www.genderstudies.ucla.edu/people/faculty] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and a Distinguished Affiliate Professor of Philosophy at [[Michigan State University]][http://www.philosophy.msu.edu/people/faculty/sandra-harding/]. In 2013 she was awarded the [[John Desmond Bernal Prize]] by the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science|Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S)]]. (Earlier recipients of this prize include [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], [[Thomas Kuhn|Thomas S. Kuhn]], [[Mary Douglas]], and [[Joseph Needham]].)

She has developed the research standard of “[[strong objectivity]],” and contributed to the articulation of [[standpoint theory|standpoint methodology]]. This kind of research process starts off from questions that arise in the daily lives of people in oppressed groups.  To answer such questions, it “studies up”, examining the principles, practices and cultures of dominant institutions, from the design and management of which oppressed groups have been excluded. She has also contributed to the development of feminist, anti-racist, multicultural, and postcolonial studies of the natural and social sciences, asking the extent to which paradigms like [[feminist empiricism]] are useful for promoting to goals of feminist inquiry.  She is the author or editor of many books and essays on these topics, and was one of the founders of the fields of [[feminist epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]].

'''Charles Hartshorne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑr|t|s|ˌ|h|ɔr|n}}; June 5, 1897&amp;nbsp;– October 9, 2000) was an [[American philosopher]] who concentrated primarily on the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[metaphysics]]. He developed the neoclassical idea of [[God]] and produced a [[modal logic|modal]] [[Arguments for the existence of God|proof of the existence of God]] that was a development of [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]]'s [[Ontological Argument]]. Hartshorne is also noted for developing [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s [[process philosophy]] into [[process theology]].

== Early life and education ==
Hartshorne (pronounced harts-horn) was born in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]], and was the son of Reverend F.C. Hartshorne. Among his brothers was the prominent geographer [[Richard Hartshorne]]. Charles attended [[Haverford College]] between 1915–17, but then spent two years as a hospital orderly serving in the US Army. He then studied at [[Harvard University]], where he earned the B.A. (1921), M.A. (1922) and PhD (1923) degrees. His doctoral dissertation was on &quot;The Unity of Being&quot;. He obtained all three degrees in only four years, an accomplishment believed unique in Harvard's history.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ɛlvesjys|lang}}; 26 January or 26 February 1715 (sources differ) – 26 December 1771) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], [[freemason]]&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cumming, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=HQ9S-xWkIBcC&amp;dq= ''Helvetius: His Life and Place in the History of Educational Thought''], Routledge, 2013, pp. 115–132.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[littérateur]]''.

==Life==
Claude Adrien Helvétius was born in [[Paris, France]], and was descended from a family of physicians, originally surnamed ''Schweitzer'' (meaning &quot;[[Switzerland|Swiss]]&quot;; Latinized as ''[[Helvetia|Helvétius]]''). His grandfather [[Johann Friedrich Schweitzer]] introduced the use of [[Carapichea ipecacuanha|ipecacuanha]]; his father [[Jean Claude Adrien Helvétius]] was first physician to [[Marie Leszczynska|Marie Leszczyńska]], queen of France. Claude Adrien was trained for a financial career, apprenticed to his maternal uncle in Caen,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1965&quot;&gt;''Helvetius: A Study in Persecution'' by David Warner Smith, Clarendon Press Oxford, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; but he occupied his spare time with poetry. Aged twenty-three, at the queen's request, he was appointed as a farmer-general, a tax-collecting post worth 100,000 crowns a year. Thus provided for, he proceeded to enjoy life to the utmost, with the help of his wealth and liberality, his literary and artistic tastes - he attended, for example, the progressive [[Club de l'Entresol]]. As he grew older, he began to seek more lasting distinctions, stimulated by the success of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] as a [[mathematician]], of [[Voltaire]] as a [[poet]], and of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] as a philosopher. His wife, [[Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius]], maintained a salon attended by the leading figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] for over five decades.

In 1758, Helvétius published his philosophical ''magnum opus'', a work called ''De l'esprit'' (On Mind).  Its atheistic, utilitarian and egalitarian doctrines raised a public outcry and Helvétius was forced to issue several retractions.

'''Carl Gustav''' &quot;'''Peter'''&quot; '''Hempel''' (January 8, 1905&amp;nbsp;– November 9, 1997) was a German writer and philosopher. He was a major figure in [[Logical positivism|logical empiricism]], a 20th-century movement in the [[philosophy of science]]. He is especially well known for his articulation of the [[deductive-nomological model]] of scientific [[explanation]], which was considered the &quot;standard model&quot; of scientific explanation during the 1950s and 1960s. He is also known for the [[raven paradox]] (also known as &quot;Hempel's paradox&quot;) which highlights the [[problem of induction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hempel/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Hempel studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] and subsequently in [[Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg]]. In [[Göttingen]], he encountered [[David Hilbert]] and was impressed by [[Hilbert's program|his program]] attempting to base all mathematics on solid [[logic]]al foundations derived from a limited number of [[axiom]]s.

'''Johann Friedrich Herbart''' (4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and founder of [[pedagogy]] as an academic discipline.

Herbart is now remembered amongst the post-Kantian philosophers mostly as making the greatest contrast to Hegel; this in particular in relation to aesthetics. That does not take into account his thought on education.

==Biography==
Born in [[Morąg|Mohrungen]] (now [[Morąg]], Poland) in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]],  Herder grew up in a poor household, educating himself from his father's Bible and songbook. In 1762, an introspective youth of seventeen, he enrolled at the local [[University of Königsberg]], where he became a student of [[Immanuel Kant]]. At the same time, Herder became an intellectual protégé of [[Johann Georg Hamann]], an intensely subjective thinker who disputed the claims of pure secular reason.

In [[philosophical theology]], he made contributions in the areas of [[theodicy]], [[eschatology]], and [[Christology]], and in the philosophy of religion he contributed to the areas of [[epistemology]] of religion and [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref name=peters&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Peters |first=Richard |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Man of Many Mysticisms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
John Hick was born on 20 January 1922 to a middle-class family in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], England. In his teens, he developed an interest in philosophy and religion, being encouraged by his uncle, who was an author and teacher at the [[University of Manchester]]. Hick initially pursued a [[law degree]] at the [[University of Hull]], but, having converted to [[Evangelical Christianity]], he decided to change his career and he enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1941.

Though on rational grounds a champion of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism for the sovereign]], Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European [[classical liberalism|liberal thought]]: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be &quot;representative&quot; and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Pierre | last = Manent | title = An Intellectual History of Liberalism | year = 1994 | pages = 20–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early work, he elaborated critiques of [[historicism]] and of [[psychologism]] in [[logic]] based on analyses of [[intentionality]]. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called [[phenomenological reduction]]. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl re-defined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl's thought profoundly influenced the landscape of [[20th-century philosophy|twentieth-century philosophy]] and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.

Rabbi '''Moses ben Jacob ibn Ezra''', known as '''Ha-Sallaḥ''' (&quot;writer of penitential prayers&quot;) ({{lang-ar|أبو هارون موسى بن يعقوب ابن عزرا}}, ''Abu Harun Musa bin Ya'acub ibn Ezra'', {{lang-he|משה בן יעקב הסלח אבן עזרא}}) was a [[Jew]]ish, Spanish [[philosopher]], linguist, and [[poet]]. He was born in [[Granada]] about 1055 &amp;ndash; 1060, and died after 1138. Ibn Ezra was Jewish by religion but is also considered to have had great influence in the Arabic literary world. He is considered one of Spain's greatest poets and  was thought to be ahead of his time in terms of his theories on the nature of poetry. One of the more revolutionary aspects of Ibn Ezra’s poetry that has been debated is his definition of poetry as metaphor and how his poetry illuminates  Aristotle’s early ideas. The impact of Ibn Ezra’s philosophical works was minor compared to his impact on poetry, but they address his concept of the  relationship between God and man.&lt;ref group=&quot;Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berenbaum|first=Michael|author2=Fred Skolnik|title=Ibn Ezra, Moses ben Jacob.|journal=Encyclopaedia Judaica|year=2007|volume=9|pages=673–675|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is notable for popularizing the term [[nihilism]] (coined by Obereit in 1787) and promoting it as the prime fault of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought particularly in the philosophical systems of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]].&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{sep entry|friedrich-jacobi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of [[speculative reason]], he advocated ''Glaube'' (variously translated as [[faith]] or &quot;belief&quot;) and [[revelation]]. In this sense, Jacobi anticipated present-day writers who criticize secular philosophy as [[Relativism|relativistic]] and dangerous for religious faith. In his time, he was also well-known among literary circles for his critique of the ''[[Sturm and Drang]]'' movement, and implicitly close associate [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and its visions of atomized [[individualism]]. His literary projects were devoted to the reconciliation of Enlightenment individualism with social obligation.

'''Karl Theodor Jaspers''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjaspɐs|lang}}; 23 February 1883 – 26 February 1969) was a German-Swiss [[psychiatrist]] and [[philosopher]] who had a strong influence on modern [[theology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[philosophy]]. After being trained in and practicing psychiatry, Jaspers turned to philosophical inquiry and attempted to discover an innovative [[philosophical system]]. He was often viewed as a major exponent of [[existentialism]] in Germany, though he did not accept this label.

'''Karl Johann Kautsky ''' (October 16, 1854 – October 17, 1938) was a Czech-Austrian philosopher, journalist, and [[Marxism|Marxist theoretician]]. Kautsky was recognized as among the most authoritative promulgators of [[Orthodox Marxism]] after the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895 until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 and was called by some the &quot;Pope of Marxism.&quot; Following the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and its excesses, engaging in polemics with [[V.I. Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] on the nature of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet state]].

'''Sir Anthony John Patrick Kenny ''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 16 March 1931) is an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose interests lie in the [[philosophy of mind]], [[ancient philosophy|ancient]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy, the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]. With [[Peter Geach]], he has made a significant contribution to [[Analytical Thomism]], a movement whose aim is to present the thought of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the style of modern philosophy by clearing away the trappings and obscurities of traditional [[Thomism]]. He is one of the executors of Wittgenstein's [[literary estate]]. He is a former President of the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]].

==Education and early career==
Kenny initially trained as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] at the [[Venerable English College]], [[Rome]], where he received a degree of [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology]] (STL) degree. He was ordained in 1955 and served as a curate in Liverpool (1959-63). Having received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] from the [[University of Oxford]] ([[St Benet's Hall, Oxford|St Benet's Hall]]) in 1961, he also worked as an assistant lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]] (1961–63). However, he questioned the validity of Roman Catholic doctrine and is now an agnostic. He was returned to the lay state in 1963, but according to [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] his priestly ordination remains valid. He was never dispensed from the obligation of clerical celibacy and was therefore [[excommunicate]]d on his marriage to Nancy Gayley in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''What I Believe'', ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
During 1963-64, Kenny was Lecturer in Philosophy at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]] Colleges, Oxford and he served as University Lecturer 1965-78. From 1964 until 1978, he was a Fellow of [[Balliol College, Oxford]] and Senior Tutor during the periods 1971-72 and 1976-78. He was [[Master (college)|Master]] of Balliol from 1978 to 1989 and subsequently an Honorary Fellow. During the period 1989-99, he was both [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[Rhodes House]] (manager of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] program) and Professorial Fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] and thereafter Fellow [[Emeritus]]. He was [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford]] from 1984 to 2001 (Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Development, 1999–2001). He retired in 2001.

'''Alejandro Korn''' (3 May 1860 – 9 October 1936) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[physician]], [[psychiatrist]], [[philosopher]], [[reformist]] and [[politician]]. For eighteen years,  he was the director of the psychiaty hospital in [[Melchor Romero]] (a locality of La Plata in [[Buenos Aires]]), named as the city. He was the first university official in [[Latin America]]  to be elected thanks to the student’s vote. He is considered to be the pioneer of Argentine philosophy. Along with [[Florentino Ameghino]], [[Juan Vucetich]], [[Pedro Bonifacio Palacios|Almafuerte]] and [[Carlos Spegazzini]], he is considered to be one of ''the five wise men'' of [[La Plata]].

'''Saul Aaron Kripke''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|l|_|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|p|k|i}}; born November 13, 1940) is an [[American philosopher]] and [[logician]]. He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the [[City University of New York]] and emeritus professor at [[Princeton University]]. Since the 1960s Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[set theory]]. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts. Kripke was the recipient of the 2001 [[Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy. A 2009 academic poll ranked Kripke among the top ten most important philosophers of the past 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog, [http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html &quot;So who *is* the most important philosopher of the past 200 years?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially [[modal logic]]. His work has profoundly influenced [[analytic philosophy]], with his principal contribution being a semantics for modal logic, involving [[possible world]]s as described in a system now called [[Kripke semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Fodor, &quot;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/jerry-fodor/waters-water-everywhere Water's water everywhere]&quot;, ''London Review of Books'', 21 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his most important contributions is his argument that necessity is a 'metaphysical' notion, which should be separated from the epistemic notion of ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and that there are [[Logical truth|necessary truths]] which are ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' truths, such as &quot;Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&quot; He has also contributed an original reading of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], referred to as &quot;[[Kripkenstein]].&quot; His most famous work is ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' (1980).

'''Imre Lakatos''' ({{lang-hu|Lakatos Imre}} {{IPA-hu|ˈlɒkɒtoʃ ˈimrɛ|}}; November 9, 1922 – February 2, 1974) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[philosopher]] of [[Philosophy of mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Philosophy of science|science]], known for his thesis of the fallibility of mathematics and its 'methodology of proofs and refutations' in its pre-axiomatic stages of development, and also for introducing the concept of the '[[research programme]]' in his methodology of scientific research programmes.

==Life==
Lakatos was born '''Imre (Avrum) Lipschitz''' to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Debrecen]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] in 1922.  He received a degree in mathematics, [[physics]], and [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Debrecen]] in 1944.  He avoided [[Nazi]] persecution of Jews by changing his name to '''Imre Molnár'''.  His mother and grandmother died in [[Auschwitz]]. He became an active [[communism|communist]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].  He changed his surname once again to ''Lakatos'' (Locksmith)  in honor of [[Géza Lakatos]].

'''Julien Offray de La Mettrie''' (November 23, 1709&lt;ref&gt;For La Mettrie's birth in literature one finds at least three different calendar dates; the date given here is most probably the correct one. Cf.: Birgit Christensen: Ironie und Skepsis, Würzburg 1996, p. 245, fn. 2&lt;/ref&gt; – November 11, 1751) was a [[France|French]] [[physician]] and [[philosopher]], and one of the earliest of the [[French materialism|French materialists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He is best known for his work ''[[Man a Machine|L'homme machine]]'' (&quot;Machine Man&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The 1748 English translation bore the title ''Man a machine'', but Ann Thomson, in her recent translation, chooses the title ''Machine man'' (Thomson 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;The Human Mechanism&quot;).

==Early life==
La Mettrie was born at [[Saint-Malo]] in Brittany on November 23, 1709, and was the son of a prosperous textile merchant. His initial schooling took place in the colleges of Coutances and Caen. After attending the [[Collège du Plessis]] in [[Paris]], he seemed to have acquired a vocational interest in becoming a clergyman, but after studying [[theology]] in the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] schools for some years, his interests turned away from the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. In 1725, La Mettrie entered the [[College d'Harcourt]] to study philosophy and natural science, probably graduating around 1728. At this time, D'Harcourt was pioneering the teaching of [[Cartesianism]] in France.&lt;ref name =aram&gt;Aram Vartanian, ''La Mettrie's ''L'Homme Machine'': A Study in the Origins of an Idea'' (Princeton University Press, 1960), p. 2-12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1734, he went on to study under [[Hermann Boerhaave]], a renowned physician who, similarly, had originally intended on becoming a clergyman. It was under Boerhaave that La Mettrie was influenced to try to bring changes to medical education in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nyirubugara|first=Olivier|title=A Sociobibliographic Study of L'homme machine|url=http://www.olny.nl/Research_Recherche/Media_Studies/O_Nyirubugara_SOCIOBIBLIOGRAPHIC_STUDY_HOMME_MACHINE.pdf|pages=3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susanne Katherina Langer''' (''née'' Knauth) (December 20, 1895 &amp;ndash; July 17, 1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''.

==Life==
Langer was born in [[Manhattan]], the daughter of German immigrants Antonio Knauth, a lawyer, and Else M. (Uhlich) Knauth. German was spoken exclusively at home and she never completely lost her accent. As a girl, Langer learned to play both the cello and piano. For her early education she attended the [[Veltin School for Girls]]. She studied at [[Radcliffe College]], receiving her bachelor's degree in 1920 and her doctorate in 1926.  Alfred North Whitehead was her dissertation adviser.  She taught at Radcliffe, [[Wellesley College]], [[Smith College]], and [[Columbia University]]. She was a visiting lecturer at a number of other institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;dryden1&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Susanne K.

It had greatly influenced her thinking. Recognizing their common ground, Cassirer remained in close contact with Langer until his death in 1945.

'''Jules Lequier''' (or ''Lequyer''; 30 January 1814 – 11 February 1862) was a French philosopher from [[Brittany]]. He wrote in favour of dynamic divine [[omniscience]], wherein God's knowledge of the future is one of possibilities rather than actualities. Omniscience, under this view, is the knowledge of necessary facts as necessary, and contingent facts as contingent. Since the future does not yet exist as anything more than a realm of abstract possibilities, it is no impugning of divine omniscience to claim that God does not know the future as a fixed and unalterable state of affairs: that he does not know what is not there to be known. Lequier's approach guarantees both divine and human freedom, and suggests a partial resolution of the apparent inconsistency of human-wrought evil and the perfect goodness, power and knowledge of God.

'''Leucippus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|uː|ˈ|s|ɪ|p|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Λεύκιππος}}, ''Leukippos''; fl. 5th century BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of [[atomism]] — the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called [[atom]]s. The name Leucippus is often associated as master to pupil with that of [[Democritus]], the philosopher who was also touted as the originator of the atomic theory. However, a brief notice in [[Diogenes Laertius]]’s life of [[Epicurus]] says that on the testimony of [[Epicurus]],  Leucippus never existed. As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. Furthermore, in his ''Corpus Democriteum'',&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnes, ''Early Greek Philosophy'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thrasyllus of Alexandria]], an astrologer and writer living under the emperor [[Tiberius]] (14–37 CE) compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus. The present consensus among the world's historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical. The matter must remain moot unless more information is forthcoming from the record.

Leucippus  was most likely born in [[Miletus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy'', pg. xxiii. Note that Democritus was a resident of Abdera. Some said Leucippus from Elea, perhaps since he was unsuitably associated with the [[Eleatics|Eleatic philosophers]].&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and [[Velia|Elea]] are also mentioned as possible birth-places.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]] says &quot;Leucippus was born at Elea, but some say at Abdera and others at Miletus,&quot; Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 30. [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] refers to him as &quot;Leucippus of Elea or Miletus,&quot; Simplicius, ''Physica'', 28, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarence Irving Lewis''' (April 12, 1883 – February 3, 1964), usually cited as '''C. I. Lewis''', was an American academic [[philosopher]] and the founder of [[conceptual pragmatism]]. First a noted [[logician]], he later branched into [[epistemology]], and during the last 20 years of his life, he wrote much on [[ethics]].  The ''[[New York Times]]'' memorialized him as &quot;a leading authority on symbolic logic and on the philosophic concepts of knowledge and value.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/04/clarence-i-lewis-philosopher-dies.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Lewis was born in [[Stoneham, Massachusetts]]. His father was a skilled worker in a shoe factory, and Lewis grew up in relatively humble circumstances. He discovered philosophy at age 13, when reading about the Greek [[pre-Socratics]], [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]] in particular. The first work of philosophy Lewis recalled studying was a short history of [[Greek philosophy]] by Marshall. [[Immanuel Kant]] proved a major lifelong influence on Lewis's thinking. In his article &quot;Logic and Pragmatism,&quot; Lewis wrote: &quot;Nothing comparable in importance happened [in my life] until I became acquainted with Kant... Kant compelled me. He had, so I felt, followed scepticism to its inevitable last stage, and laid the foundations where they could not be disturbed.&quot;

'''Theodor Lipps''' (28 July 1851, [[Wallhalben]] – 17 October 1914, [[Munich]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. 

==Biography==
Lipps was one of the most influential German university professors of his time, attracting many students from other countries. Lipps was very concerned with conceptions of art and the aesthetic, focusing much of his philosophy around such issues. Among his fervent admirers was [[Sigmund Freud]], Lipps then being the main supporter of the idea of the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigman, G.W. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7628894&amp;dopt=Abstract Freud and the history of empathy], ''The International journal of psycho-analysis'', 1995 Apr;76 (Pt 2):237-56.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that each state had its level of consciousness and that laughter was associated with hidden negative aspects. He adopted [[Robert Vischer]]'s notions of [[empathy]] or esthetic sympathy (''Einfühlung''). Late in life, Lipps adopted some ideas from [[Husserl]]. Disliking his psychologism, some of his students joined with some of Husserl's to form a new branch of philosophy called [[Phenomenology of essences]].

'''William G. Lycan''' (born September 26, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] teaching at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he is the William Rand Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor. He won the Class of 2001 Outstanding Faculty Award (in 2001) and a Distinguished Teaching Award for Post-Baccalaureate Instruction in 2002.  Before moving to UNC in 1982, Lycan taught for twelve years at [[Ohio State University]].  Since 2011, Lycan has also been Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Connecticut]].

His principal interests include [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], philosophy of [[linguistics]], [[epistemology]], and  [[metaphysics]].  The author of eight books and over 150 articles (and over 20 reviews) Lycan is an advocate of the version of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], known as ''homuncular functionalism''.

Lycan is an unapologetic realist and physicalist about almost everything – mental states (intentionality and consciousness), epistemic justification, linguistic meaning, perception (especially color and smell), moral properties, aesthetic properties, and more. This realist, physicalist philosophical tapestry is held together by several common threads: the view that persons are complex systems composed of sub-personal systems, sub-sub-personal systems, etc., all the way down to sub-atomic functions; the view that natural teleology is ubiquitous, that there exists a non-ideal but nonetheless discernible evolved fit between human capacities and the environment; the view that meaning in natural language manifests a logical form that at its core is truth-functional; and more.

These (and other) common threads are prominent in Lycan’s theories of mind. Mental states are type-identical to functional states instantiated in sub- or sub-sub-personal systems, where the function of any such state is determined by its natural teleology. This is Lycan’s Homuncular Functionalism. The appeal to teleology dissolves problems with earlier functionalist theories, especially those concerning consciousness. A correct theory of consciousness, on Lycan’s view, comprises multiple parts corresponding to the multiple phenomena to which the term ‘consciousness’ is applied. Thus, Lycan defends a higher-order, inner sense theory of awareness, according to which attention mechanisms have the function of monitoring and integrating lower level psychological processes; a pronominal theory of subjectivity, according to which the subjective or perspectival nature of conscious states is a product of the utterly unique semantic role of introspective mental concepts (e.g., ‘I’); a representational theory of qualia, according to which sensory qualities are the intentional objects of sensory representations; and more.

'''Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli ''' ({{IPA-it|nikkoˈlɔ mmakjaˈvɛlli|lang}}; 3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an Italian Renaissance historian, politician, diplomat, philosopher, [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]], and writer. He has often been called the founder of modern [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu (1689–1755) is a rival for this role. {{cite book|author=Mikko Lahtinen|title=Politics and Philosophy: Niccolò Machiavelli and Louis Althusser's Aleatory Materialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSywCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2009|publisher=BRILL|pages=115–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was for many years a senior official in the [[Florentine Republic]], with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is renowned in the [[Italian language]]. He was secretary to the Second [[wikt:chancery|Chancery]] of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the [[Medici]] were out of power. He wrote his most renowned work ''[[The Prince]]'' (''Il Principe'') in 1513.

&quot;[[Machiavellianism]]&quot; is a widely used negative term to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli described most famously in ''The Prince.'' Machiavelli described immoral behavior, such as dishonesty and killing innocents, as being normal and effective in politics. He even seemed to endorse it in some situations. The book itself gained notoriety when some readers claimed that the author was teaching evil, and providing &quot;evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Giorgini, &quot;Five Hundred Years of Italian Scholarship on Machiavelli's Prince,&quot; ''Review of Politics'' (2013) 75#4 pp 625-640&lt;/ref&gt;  The term &quot;Machiavellian&quot; is often associated with political deceit, deviousness, and ''[[realpolitik]]''. On the other hand, many commentators, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Denis Diderot]], have argued that Machiavelli was actually a Republican, even when writing ''The Prince'', and his writings were an inspiration to Enlightenment proponents of modern democratic political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;B.

'''Salomon ben Josua Maimon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|m|ɒ|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈmaɪmoːn|lang}}; {{lang-he|שלמה מימון}}&amp;lrm;; 1753 &amp;ndash; 22 November 1800) was a German-speaking philosopher, born of Jewish parentage in present-day [[Belarus]].

==Early years==
Salomon Maimon was born in the town of Zhukov Borok near [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (present-day [[Belarus]]), where his grandfather leased an estate from a Prince [[Karol Stanisław &quot;Panie Kochanku&quot; Radziwiłł]].&lt;ref name=&quot;socher&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Socher|first=Abraham P.|title=The Radical Enlightenment of Solomon Maimon: Judaism, Heresy, and Philosophy|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0804751366}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–22}} He was taught [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]], first by his father, and later by instructors in Mir. He was recognized as a prodigy in Talmudic studies, which he later described as &quot;endless disputation without end or aim&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;socher&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}} His parents fell on hard times, and betrothed him to two separate girls in order to take advantage of their dowries, leading to a bitter rivalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;socher&quot; /&gt;{{rp|26}} At the age of eleven he was married to one of the two prospects, a girl from [[Nesvizh]]. At the age 14 he was already a father and was making money by teaching Talmud. Later he learned some German from books and walked all the way to [[Slutsk]], where he met a rabbi who had studied in Germany. He borrowed German books on physics, optics and medicine from him. After that he became determined to study further. He abandoned his family at the age of 22.

I saw in a booklet that the Ark of God, even Rabbi Moses b. Maimon, of blessed memory, had been taken up (i.e. euphemism for &quot;had died&quot;), in the year [4],965 [[anno mundi]] (= 1204/5 CE) in Egypt, and the Jews wept for him – as did [all] the Egyptians – three days, and they coined a name for that time of year, [saying], 'there was wailing,' and on the seventh day [of his passing], the news reached Alexandria, and on the eighth day, [the news reached] Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem they made a great public mourning [on his behalf] and called for a fast and public gathering, where it was that the prayer precentor read out the admonitions, 'If you shall walk in my statutes [etc.]' (Leviticus 26:3-ff.), as well as read the concluding verse [from the Prophets], 'And it came to pass that Samuel spoke to all of Israel [etc.],' and he then concluded by saying that the Ark of God had been taken away. Now after certain days they brought up his coffin to the Land of Israel, during which journey thieves encountered them, causing those who had gone up to flee, leaving there the coffin. Now the thieves, when they saw that they had all fled, they desired to have the coffin cast into the sea, but were unable with all their strength to uproot the coffin from the ground, even though they had been more than thirty men, and when they considered the matter, they then said to themselves that he was a godly and holy man, and so they went their way. However, they gave assurances to the Jews that they would escort them to their destination, and so it was that they also accompanied him and '''he was buried in Tiberias'''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a [[rabbi]], [[physician]], and [[philosopher]] in [[Morocco]] and [[Egypt]].

During his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides's writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, even as far away as Iraq and Yemen, and although Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish community in Egypt]], there were also vociferous critics of some of his writings, particularly in Spain. Nonetheless, he was posthumously acknowledged as among the foremost rabbinical [[Posek|arbiters]] and philosophers in [[Jewish history]], and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of [[Talmud]]ic law. In the [[Yeshiva]] world, he is called sometimes &quot;ha Nesher ha Gadol&quot; (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a ''bona fide'' exponent of the [[Oral Torah]].

The author of over a dozen books and at least thirty plays, Marcel's work focused on the modern individual's struggle in a technologically dehumanizing society. Though often regarded as the first French existentialist, he dissociated himself from figures such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], preferring the term 'Philosophy of Existence' to define his own thought. ''[[The Mystery of Being]]'' is a well-known two-volume work authored by Marcel.

==Early life and education==

'''Joseph Maréchal''' (1 July 1878 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1944) was a Belgian [[Jesuit]] priest, philosopher, theologian and psychologist. He taught at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]] and was the founder of the school of thought called [[Thomism|Transcendental Thomism]], which attempted to merge the theological and philosophical thought of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] with that of [[Immanuel Kant]].

==Life and thought==
Maréchal joined the Jesuits in 1895 and after a doctorate in [[biology]] at Leuven (1905) he first specialized in [[experimental psychology]], spending some time in [[Munich]] with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1911). Until the end of his life Maréchal would say that his real interest was more in psychology than in philosophy.

'''Jacques Maritain''' (18 November 1882&amp;nbsp;– 28 April 1973) was a French [[Catholic]] [[philosopher]]. Raised as a [[Protestant]], he became an agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books, he helped to revive St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] for modern times, and was influential in the development and drafting of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] presented his &quot;Message to Men of Thought and of Science&quot; at the close of [[Vatican II]] to Maritain, his long-time friend and mentor. Maritain's interest and works spanned many aspects of [[philosophy]], including [[aesthetics]], [[political theory]], [[philosophy of science]], [[metaphysics]], the nature of [[education]], [[liturgy]] and [[ecclesiology]].

'''George Herbert Mead''' (February 27, 1863 – April 26, 1931) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]] and [[psychologist]], primarily affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]], where he was one of several distinguished [[pragmatism|pragmatist]]s. He is regarded as one of the founders of [[social psychology]] and the American sociological tradition in general.

== Biography ==
Mead was born February 27, 1863 in [[South Hadley]], Massachusetts. He was raised in a Protestant, middle-class family comprising his father, Hiram Mead, his mother, Elizabeth Storrs (Billings) Mead, and his sister Alice. His father was a former [[Congregationalist]] Pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology at [[Oberlin College]]’s theological seminary. [[Elizabeth Storrs Mead]] taught for two years at Oberlin College and subsequently, from 1890 to 1900, served as president of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = John | authorlink = | title = George Herbert Mead | publisher = Sage | year = 2009 | location = | page= 7 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8039-2320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, George Mead enrolled at Oberlin College, graduating in 1883 with a BA degree. After graduation, Mead taught grade school for about four months. For the following three years, he worked as a surveyor for the [[Wisconsin Central Railroad Company]].

Little is known about his life except that he was the commander of the Samian fleet shortly before the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Melissus’ contribution to philosophy was a treatise of systematic arguments supporting Eleatic philosophy.  Like Parmenides, he argued that reality is ungenerated, indestructible, indivisible, changeless, and motionless. In addition, he sought to show that reality is wholly unlimited, and infinitely extended in all directions; and since existence is unlimited, it must also be one.

Born to a poor Jewish family in [[Dessau]] and originally destined for a [[rabbi]]nical career, Mendelssohn educated himself in [[Germany|German]] thought and literature and from his writings on philosophy and religion came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Christian and Jewish inhabitants of the [[Holy Roman Empire of German Nation|Holy Roman Empire]]. He also established himself as an important figure in the Berlin [[textile]] industry, which was the foundation of his family's wealth.

Moses Mendelssohn's descendants include the composers [[Fanny Mendelssohn|Fanny]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and the founders of the [[Mendelssohn &amp; Co.]] banking house.

'''James Mill''', born James Milne (6 April 1773 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1836) was a Scottish [[historian]], [[economist]], [[political theorist]], and [[philosopher]]. He often lists as a founder of [[classical economics]], together with [[David Ricardo]] and Adam Smith,&lt;ref name=&quot;keynes11&quot;&gt;''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]],'' [[John Maynard Keynes]], Chapter 1, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch01.htm#1 Footnote 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and as the father of [[John Stuart Mill]], the philosopher of [[liberalism]]. His influential ''[[The History of British India|History of British India]]'' contains a complete denunciation and rejection of Indian culture and civilisation. He divided Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British.

==Life==
James Milne, later known as James Mill, was born at Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, [[Angus]], Scotland, the son of James Milne, a [[shoemaker]]. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the [[Jacobite rising|Stuart rising]], resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the [[Montrose Academy]], where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.

In October 1798, he was ordained as a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], but met with little success. From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to [[London]], England, in company with [[Sir John Stuart, 4th Baronet|Sir John Stuart]] of [[Fettercairn]], then member of parliament for [[Kincardineshire]], and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the ''Literary Journal'', which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the ''St James's Chronicle'', belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of ''An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther'', a [[Charles de Villers|C.F. Villers]]'s work  on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year he began his ''[[The History of British India]]'', which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.

'''Michel Eyquem de Montaigne''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/montaigne &quot;Montaigne&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ekɛm də mɔ̃tɛɲ|lang}}; 28 February 1533&amp;nbsp;– 13 September 1592) was one of the most significant philosophers of the [[French Renaissance]], known for popularizing the [[essay]] as a [[literary genre]]. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes&lt;ref&gt;His anecdotes are 'casual' only in appearance; Montaigne writes: 'Neither my anecdotes nor my quotations are always employed simply as examples, for authority, or for ornament...They often carry, off the subject under discussion, the seed of a richer and more daring matter, and they resonate obliquely with a more delicate tone,' Michel de Montaigne, ''Essais'', Pléiade, Paris (ed. A. Thibaudet) 1937, Bk. 1, ch.40, p. 252 (tr. Charles Rosen)&lt;/ref&gt; and autobiography with serious intellectual insight; his massive volume ''[[Essais]]'' (translated literally as &quot;Attempts&quot; or &quot;Trials&quot;) contains some of the most influential essays ever written. Montaigne had a direct influence on writers all over the world, including [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Michael J., At the Origins of Modern Atheism, Yale UP, 1990, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[William Hazlitt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinnaird p. 274&quot;&gt;Kinnaird, John, ''William Hazlitt: Critic of Power'', Columbia University Press, 1978, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Eric Hoffer]],&lt;ref&gt;from ''Truth Imagined'', memoir by Eric Hoffer.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]], and possibly on the later works of [[William Shakespeare]]. 

In his own lifetime, Montaigne was admired more as a [[Politician|statesman]] than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, 'I am myself the matter of my book', was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne would come to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt which began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] remark, &quot;''Que sçay-je''?&quot; (&quot;What do I know?&quot;, in [[Middle French]]; directly rendered ''Que sais-je?'' in modern French). Remarkably modern even to readers today, Montaigne's attempt to examine the world through the lens of the only thing he can depend on implicitly—his own judgment—makes him more accessible to modern readers than any other author of the Renaissance. Much of modern literary non-fiction has found inspiration in Montaigne and writers of all kinds continue to read him for his masterful balance of intellectual knowledge and personal storytelling.

Born in Milk Street in London, on 7 February 1478, Thomas More was the son of [[Sir John More]],&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, A. (13 June 2009).

More began his studies at Oxford in 1492, and received a classical education. Studying under [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]], he became proficient in both Latin and Greek.

According to his friend, theologian [[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]], More once seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career to become a [[monk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|contribution=Letter to Ulrich von Hutten|editor-last=Adams|editor-first=Robert M.|title=Utopia|location=New York|publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erasmus to Ulrich von Hutten|work=The Center for Thomas More Studies.

'''Emmanuel Mounier''' (1 May 1905, [[Grenoble]] – 22 March 1950, [[Châtenay-Malabry]]) was a French philosopher, theologian and essayist.

==Biography==
Mounier was the guiding spirit in the French [[Personalism|Personalist]] movement, and founder and director of ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', the magazine which was the organ of the movement. Mounier, who was the child of peasants, was a brilliant scholar at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1929, when he was only twenty-four, he came under the influence of the French writer, [[Charles Péguy]], to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement. Mounier's personalism became a main influence of the [[non-conformists of the 1930s]].

[[Peter Maurin]] used to say wherever he went, &quot;There is a man in France called Emmanuel Mounier. He wrote a book called ''The Personalist Manifesto''. You should read that book.&quot;

'''Ṣadr ad-Dīn Muḥammad Shīrāzī''', also called '''Mulla Sadrā''' ({{lang-fa|ملا صدرا}}; also spelled '''Molla Sadra''', '''Mollasadra''' or '''Sadr-ol-Mote'allehin'''; {{lang-ar|صدرالمتألهین}}) (c. 1571/2 – 1640), a [[Iranian philosophy|Iranian]] [[Shia]] [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Kalam|theologian]] and [[Ulema|‘Ālim]] who led the [[Iran]]ian cultural renaissance in the 17th century.  According to [[Oliver Leaman]], Mulla Sadra is arguably the single most important and influential philosopher in the Muslim world in the last four hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2007), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.htm Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad al-Shirazi) (1571/2-1640)] by  John Cooper&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not its founder, he is considered the master of the Illuminationist (or, Ishraghi or [[Illuminationist philosophy|Ishraqi]]) school of Philosophy, a seminal figure who synthesized the many tracts of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] philosophies into what he called the [[Transcendent Theosophy]] or ''al-hikmah al-muta’liyah''.

Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian [[nonviolence]] and on several occasions participated in [[direct action]].

Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early [[post-war]] period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time, they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems. Naess believed that the [[environmental crisis]] of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged.&lt;ref name=&quot;luke&quot;/&gt;

Nagel was born in [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] (now in [[Slovakia]], then [[Vágújhely]] and part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]). His mother, Frida Weiss, was from the nearby town of [[Vrbové]] (or Verbo). He emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with his family, and became a U.S. citizen in 1919. He received a BSc from the [[City College of New York]] in 1923, and earned his PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1931, with a dissertation on the concept of measurement. Except for one year (1966-1967) at [[Rockefeller University]], he spent his entire academic career at Columbia, becoming a University Professor in 1967 until his retirement in 1970, after which he continued to teach. He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1977.

'''John Henry Newman''' [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Cong. Orat.]] (21 February 1801&amp;nbsp;– 11 August 1890&lt;ref name=HRCNewman&gt;{{cite web |last=Miranda |first=Salvador |title=John Henry Newman |url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1879.htm#Newman |work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEnc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10794a.htm Barry, William. &quot;John Henry Newman.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 Aug. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;), also referred to as '''Cardinal Newman''', '''John Henry Cardinal Newman''', and '''Blessed John Henry Newman''', was an important figure in the religious history of England in the 19th century. He was known nationally by the mid-1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Gilley, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally an [[evangelical]] [[Oxford University]] academic and priest in the [[Church of England]], Newman then became drawn to the [[high-church]] tradition of [[Anglicanism]]. He became known as a leader of, and an able polemicist for, the [[Oxford Movement]], an influential and controversial grouping of Anglicans who wished to return to the Church of England many [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] beliefs and liturgical rituals from before the [[English Reformation]]. In this the movement had some success. However, in 1845 Newman, joined by some but not all of his followers, left the Church of England and his teaching post at Oxford University and was received into the Catholic Church. He was quickly ordained as a priest and continued as an influential religious leader, based in Birmingham. In 1879, he was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinal deacon|cardinal]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in recognition of his services to the cause of the Catholic Church in England. He was instrumental in the founding of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin|first=Brian|title=John Henry Newman: his life and work|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2001|pages=96–112|isbn=978-0-8264-4993-1|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=IZKW51HSqOUC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22john+henry+newman%22+%22catholic+university+of+ireland%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mR7BTfysNNSbhQf23sS9BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved into [[University College, Dublin]], today the largest university in Ireland.

Newman's [[beatification]] was officially proclaimed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 19 September 2010 during his [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom#cite note-18|visit to the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Beatification/&gt; His [[Canonization|canonisation]] is dependent on the documentation of additional miracles attributed to his [[Intercession of saints|intercession]].

Newman was also a literary figure of note: his major writings including the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'' (1833–1841), his autobiography ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' (1865–66), the ''[[Grammar of Assent]]'' (1870), and the poem ''[[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|The Dream of Gerontius]]'' (1865),&lt;ref name=&quot;CEnc&quot;/&gt; which was [[The Dream of Gerontius|set to music]] in 1900 by [[Edward Elgar]]. He wrote the popular hymns &quot;[[Lead, Kindly Light]]&quot; and &quot;Praise to the Holiest in the Height&quot; (taken from ''Gerontius'').

'''Nicholas of Kues''' (1401 – 11 August 1464), also referred to as '''Nicolaus Cusanus''' and '''Nicholas of Cusa''',  was a [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Theology|theologian]], [[jurist]], and [[Astronomy|astronomer]]. One of the first German proponents of [[Renaissance humanism]], he made spiritual and political contributions in European history. A notable example of this is his mystical or spiritual writings on &quot;learned ignorance,&quot; as well as his participation in power struggles between [[Roman Curia|Rome]] and the German states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

'''José Ortega y Gasset''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse orˈteɣa i ɣaˈset}}; 9 May 1883&amp;nbsp;– 18 October 1955) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], and essayist. He worked during the first half of the 20th century, while Spain oscillated between [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|monarchy]], [[Second Spanish Republic|republicanism]], and [[Spanish Civil War|dictatorship]]. His [[philosophy]] has been characterized as a &quot;[[philosophy of life]]&quot; that &quot;comprised a long-hidden beginning in a [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[metaphysics]] inspired by [[William James]], and with a general [[Methodology|method]] from a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] imitating [[Edmund Husserl]], which served both his proto-[[existentialism]] (prior to [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]]) and his realist [[historicism]], which has been compared to both  [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Benedetto Croce]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John T. Graham. ''A Pragmatist Philosophy of Life in Ortega y Gasset''. (University of Missouri Press, 1994), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
José Ortega y Gasset was born 9 May 1883 in [[Madrid]]. His father was director of the newspaper ''El Imparcial'', which belonged to the family of his mother, Dolores Gasset. The family was definitively of Spain's end-of-the-century liberal and educated bourgeoisie. The liberal tradition and journalistic engagement of his family had a profound influence in Ortega y Gasset's activism in politics.

(1999) ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', pages 41-2. Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Rhodes]] was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher. He was a pupil of [[Diogenes of Babylon]] and [[Antipater of Tarsus]] in [[Athens]], before moving to [[Rome]] where he did much to introduce Stoic doctrines to the city. After the death of Scipio in 129 BC, he returned to the Stoic school in Athens, and was its last undisputed [[scholarch]]. With Panaetius, Stoicism became much more eclectic. His most famous work was his ''On Duties'', the principal source used by [[Cicero]] in [[De Officiis|his own work]] of the same name.

'''Derek Parfit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|f|ɪ|t}}; born 11 December 1942) is a British philosopher who specialises in problems of [[personal identity]], [[rationality]], ethics, and the relations among them.

His 1984 book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (described by [[Alan Ryan]] in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' as &quot;something close to a work of genius&quot;) has been very influential. His most recent book, ''[[On What Matters]]'' (2011), was widely circulated and discussed for many years before its publication.

He was the founder of the [[Eleatic school]] of [[philosophy]]. The single known work of Parmenides is a [[poem]], ''On Nature'', which has survived only in fragmentary form. In this poem, Parmenides describes two views of [[reality]]. In &quot;the way of truth&quot; (a part of the poem), he explains how reality (coined as &quot;what-is&quot;) is one, [[Change (mathematics)|change]] is impossible, and [[existence]] is timeless, uniform, necessary, and unchanging. In &quot;the way of opinion,&quot; he explains the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. These ideas had a strong effect on [[Plato]], and in turn, influenced the whole of [[Western philosophy]].

==Early life==
Parmenides was born in the [[Greek colony]] of [[Velia|Elea]] (now [[Ascea]]), which, according to [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, i.164&lt;/ref&gt; had been founded shortly before 535 BCE. He was descended from a wealthy and illustrious family.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi''' ({{IPA-it|pestaˈlɔttsi|pron}}; January 12, 1746 – February 17, 1827) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] and educational reformer who exemplified [[Romanticism]] in his approach.

He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was &quot;Learning by head, hand and heart&quot;. Thanks to Pestalozzi, illiteracy in 18th-century Switzerland was overcome almost completely by 1830.

'''Georgius Gemistus''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Γεμιστός}}; {{circa|1355}} – 1452/1454), later called '''Plethon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|θ|ɒ|n|,_|-|θ|ə|n}}) or '''Pletho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|θ|oʊ}}; {{lang|el|Πλήθων}}), was a [[Byzantine Greeks|Greek]] scholar of [[Neoplatonic]] philosophy. He was one of the chief pioneers of the revival of Greek learning in [[Western Europe]]. In the dying years of the [[Byzantine Empire]], he advocated a return to the [[Olympian gods]] of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clogg, [[Woodhouse, Christopher Montague]], fifth Baron Terrington (1917–2001)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, Jan 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He re-introduced Plato's thoughts to Western Europe during the 1438–1439 [[Council of Florence]], a failed attempt to reconcile the [[East-West schism]]. Here Pletho met and influenced [[Cosimo de' Medici]] to found a new [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]], which, under [[Marsilio Ficino]], would proceed to translate into Latin all Plato's works, the ''[[Enneads]]'' of Plotinus, and various other Neoplatonist works.

'''Harold Arthur Prichard''' (1871–1947), usually cited as '''H. A. Pritchard''', was an English philosopher. He was born in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard (a solicitor) and his wife Lucy. Harold Prichard was a scholar of [[Clifton College]] from where he won a scholarship to [[New College, Oxford]], to study mathematics. But after taking First Class honours in mathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied [[Greats]] (ancient history and philosophy) taking First Class Honours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of [[Hertford College]] (1895–98) and then of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] (1898–1924). He took early retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of ill health, but recovered and was elected [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] in 1928 and became a fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].  He retired in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dancy|first=Jonathan|title=Harold Arthur Prichard|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prichard/#PriMor|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He set forth one of the most elaborate and fully developed systems of [[Neoplatonism]]. He stands near the end of the classical development of [[philosophy]], and was very influential on Western [[medieval philosophy]] (Greek and Latin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Laurence| last=Rosan| year= 1981|title= Neoplatonism and Indian Thought (Editor: R Baine Harris)|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0873955461|pages=45-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Proclus was born February 8, 412 AD (his birth date is deduced from a [[horoscope]] cast by a disciple, [[Marinus of Neapolis|Marinus]]) in [[Constantinople]] to a family of high social status in [[Lycia]] (his father Patricius was a high legal official, very important in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s court system) and raised in [[Xanthos|Xanthus]]. He studied [[rhetoric]], [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]] in [[Alexandria]], with the intent of pursuing a judicial position like his father. Before completing his studies, he returned to Constantinople when his rector, his principal instructor (one [[Leonas]]), had business there.

In his dialogue, ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Plato credits him with having invented the role of the professional sophist.

He also is believed to have created a major controversy during ancient times through his statement that, &quot;Man is the measure of all things&quot;, interpreted by Plato to mean that there is no absolute truth, but that which individuals deem to be the truth. Although there is reason to question the extent of the interpretation of his arguments that has followed, that concept of individual relativity was revolutionary for the time, and contrasted with other philosophical doctrines that claimed the universe was based on something objective, outside of human influence or perceptions.

In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the [[type physicalism|type-identity]] of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the [[multiple realizability]] of the mental, and for the concept of [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], an influential theory regarding the [[mind–body problem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=LeDoux, J. |title=The Synaptic Self; How Our Brains Become Who We Are| publisher=Viking Penguin|location=New York|year=2002|isbn=88-7078-795-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy of language, along with [[Saul Kripke]] and others, he developed the [[causal theory of reference]], and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of [[externalism|semantic externalism]] based on a famous [[thought experiment]] called [[Twin Earth thought experiment|Twin Earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CH&quot;&gt;P.

'''Pyrrho''' ({{IPAc-en|'|p|ɪ|r|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Πύρρων}} ''Pyrrōn'', c. 360 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 270 BC), a Greek [[philosopher]] of [[Classical Antiquity]], was a student of Eastern philosophy and is credited as being the first Greek [[skeptic]] philosopher and the inspiration for the school known as [[Pyrrhonism]], founded by [[Aenesidemus]] in the 1st century BC. He was exposed to Eastern (Indian) philosophy and introduced it to Greece and is popularly known for his skeptic philosophy modeled on the pioneering Indian skeptical philosophical schools and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.josephwaligore.com/greek-philosophy/indian-influence-on-hellenistic-philosophy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Pyrrho was from [[Elis]], on the [[Ionian Sea]]. [[Diogenes Laertius]], quoting from [[Apollodorus of Athens]], says that Pyrrho was at first a painter, and that pictures by him were exhibited in the gymnasium at Elis. Later he was diverted to philosophy by the works of [[Democritus]], and according to Diogenes Laertius became acquainted with the [[Megarian school of philosophy|Megarian dialectic]] through [[Bryson of Achaea|Bryson]], pupil of [[Stilpo]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes' testimony is doubtful. See Bett (2000) 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrrho, along with [[Anaxarchus]], travelled with [[Alexander the Great]] on his exploration of the East, and studied under the [[Gymnosophists]] in [[India]] and the [[Magi]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. This exposure to [[Eastern philosophy]] seems to have inspired him to adopt a life of solitude; returning to Elis, he lived in poor circumstances, but was highly honored by the Elians and also by the Athenians, who conferred upon him the rights of citizenship.

Pythagoras made influential contributions to [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great [[mathematician]] and [[scientist]] and is best known for the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which bears his name. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to [[mathematics]] or [[natural philosophy]]. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 = [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58.  Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on [[Plato]], and through him, all of [[Western philosophy]].

He was influential in the areas of science, education, and of logical empiricism. He founded the ''Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie'' (Society for Empirical Philosophy) in Berlin in 1928, also known as the “[[Berlin Circle]].” Carl Gustav Hempel, Richard von Mises, David Hilbert and Kurt Grelling all became members of the Berlin Circle. He authored ''The Rise of Scientific Philosophy''. In 1930, Reichenbach and Carnap became editors of the journal Erkenntnis (Knowledge). He also made lasting contributions to the study of empiricism based on a theory of probability; the logic and the philosophy of mathematics; space, time, and relativity theory; analysis of probabilistic reasoning; and quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Thomas Reid''' [[FRSE]] ({{IPAc-en|r|iː|d}}; 26 April 1710 – 7 October 1796) was a religiously trained Scottish philosopher, a contemporary of [[David Hume]] as well as &quot;Hume's earliest and fiercest critic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Craig G. Bartholomew and Michael W. Goheen, ''Christian Philosophy'' page 138 (Baker Academic, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] and played an integral role in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. The early part of his life was spent in [[Aberdeen]] and he graduated from the [[University of Aberdeen]]. He began his career as a [[Minister (Christianity)|Minister]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] but ceased to be a Minister (or called 'Reverend') when he was given a professorship at [[King's College, Aberdeen]] in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote ''An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the 'Aberdeen Philosophical Society' which was popularly known as the 'Wise Club' (a literary-philosophical association).&lt;ref&gt;See H. Lewis Ulman, ''The Minutes of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society 1758-1773'' (Aberdeen University Press for Aberdeen University Studies Committee, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|Professorship of Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was called to replace [[Adam Smith]]. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: ''Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man'' (1785) and ''Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind'' (1788). Reid was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of [[Glasgow University|Glasgow College]] and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building. See separate article on [[Thomas Reid's tombstone]].

Reid believed that [[common sense]] (in a special philosophical sense of ''[[sensus communis]]'') is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Reid|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reid/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and [[George Berkeley]], who asserted that the external world is merely ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our ''sensus communis'' are built justify our belief that there is an external world.

In his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume.&lt;ref&gt;See Craig G. Bartholomew and Michael W. Goheen, ''Christian Philosophy'' page 138 (Baker Academic, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated [[direct realism]], or [[Naïve realism|common sense realism]], and argued strongly against the [[Idealism|Theory of Ideas]] advocated by [[John Locke]], [[René Descartes]], and (in varying forms) nearly all [[17th-century philosophy|Early Modern philosophers]] who came after them. He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid's ''Inquiry.'' Hume responded that the &quot;deeply philosophical&quot; work &quot;is wrote in a lively and entertaining matter,&quot; but that &quot;there seems to be some defect in method,&quot; and criticized Reid for implying the presence of innate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Reid.

'''Karl Leonhard Reinhold''' (26 October 1757 – 10 April 1823) was an Austrian [[philosophy|philosopher]]. He was the father of [[Ernst Christian Gottlieb Reinhold]] (1793-1855), also a philosopher.

==Life==
Reinhold was born in [[Vienna]]. At the age of fourteen he entered the [[Jesuit]] college of St. Anna, on the dissolution of which (1773) he joined a similar college of the order of St. Barnabas. Finding himself out of sympathy with monastic life, he fled in 1783 to North Germany, and settled in [[Weimar]], where he became [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s collaborator on the ''German Mercury'' (''[[Der Teutsche Merkur]]''), and eventually his son-in-law. Reinhold married Wieland's daughter Sophia Catharina Susanna Wieland (October 19, 1768 - September 1, 1837) on May 18, 1785.

'''Paul Ricœur''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁikœʁ|lang}}; 27 February 1913 – 20 May 2005) was a [[French people|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] best known for combining [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] description with [[hermeneutics]]. As such, his thought is within the same tradition as other major hermeneutic phenomenologists, [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. In 2000, he was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]] for having &quot;revolutionized the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, expanding the study of textual interpretation to include the broad yet concrete domains of mythology, biblical exegesis, psychoanalysis, theory of metaphor, and narrative theory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Ricœur|url=http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k16_c_paul/prf_e.html|publisher=Inamori Foundation|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Franz Rosenzweig was born in [[Kassel]], Germany to a middle-class, minimally observant, Jewish family. He studied history and philosophy at the universities of [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], and [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|Freiburg]].

Rosenzweig, under the influence of his cousins and his close friend [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], considered converting to [[Christianity]]. Determined to embrace the faith as the early Christians did, he resolved to live as an observant Jew first, before becoming Christian. After attending [[Yom Kippur]] services at a small Orthodox synagogue in Berlin, he underwent a mystical experience. As a result, he became a [[baal teshuva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Josiah Royce''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɔɪ|s}}; November 20, 1855 – September 14, 1916) was an American [[objective idealism|objective idealist]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Royce, born in [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]], [[California]], on November 20, 1855. He was the son of Josiah and Sarah Eleanor (Bayliss) Royce, whose families were recent English emigrants, and who sought their fortune in the [[California Gold Rush|westward movement]] of the American pioneers in 1849. He received the [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (which moved from Oakland to Berkeley during his matriculation) in 1875 where he later accepted an instructorship teaching English composition, literature, and rhetoric. After some time in Germany, where he studied with [[Hermann Lotze]], the new [[Johns Hopkins University]] awarded him in 1878 one of its first four doctorates, in [[philosophy]]. At Johns Hopkins he taught a course on the history of German thought, which was “one of his chief interests” because he was able to give consideration to the philosophy of history.&lt;ref&gt;Earl Pomeroy, &quot;Josiah Royce, Historian in Quest of Community.&quot; The Pacific Historical Review 40 (1971): 1–20.

Royce's position at Harvard was made permanent in 1884 and he remained there until his death, on September 14, 1916.

'''Max Ferdinand Scheler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃeːlɐ|lang}}; 22 August 1874 – 19 May 1928) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] known for his work in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], and [[philosophical anthropology]]. Scheler developed further the [[philosophical method]] of the founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], and was called by [[José Ortega y Gasset]] &quot;the first man of the philosophical paradise.&quot;  After his death in 1928, [[Martin Heidegger]] affirmed, with Ortega y Gasset, that all philosophers of the century were indebted to Scheler and praised him as &quot;the strongest philosophical force in modern Germany, nay, in contemporary Europe and in contemporary philosophy as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, “In memoriam Max Scheler,” trans. Michael Heim (Indiana University Press, 1984), pp. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1954, Karol Wojtyła, later [[Pope John Paul II]], defended his doctoral thesis on &quot;An Evaluation of the Possibility of Constructing a [[Christian Ethics]] on the Basis of the System of Max Scheler.&quot;

'''Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃlaɪɐˌmaχɐ|lang}}; November 21, 1768 – February 12, 1834) was a German [[theology|theologian]], [[philosopher]], and [[biblical scholar]] known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with traditional [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]]. He also became influential in the evolution of [[Higher Criticism]], and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of [[hermeneutics]].  Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the &quot;Father of Modern Liberal Theology&quot; and is considered an early leader in [[liberal Christianity]]. The [[Neo-Orthodoxy]] movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by [[Karl Barth]], was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

'''Friedrich Albert Moritz Schlick''' ({{IPA-de|ʃlɪk|lang|de_schli.ogg}}; April 14, 1882 – June 22, 1936) was a [[Germany|German]] philosopher, physicist and the founding father of [[logical positivism]] and the [[Vienna Circle]].

==Early life and works==
Schlick was born in [[Berlin]] to a wealthy family, his father was Ernst Albert Schlick and his mother was Agnes Arndt. He studied [[physics]] at [[Heidelberg]], [[Lausanne]], and, ultimately, the [[University of Berlin]] under [[Max Planck]]. In 1904, he completed his dissertation essay, &quot;Über die Reflexion des Lichts in einer inhomogenen Schicht&quot; (&quot;On the Reflection of Light in a Non-Homogeneous Medium&quot;). After a year as Privatdozent at Göttingen, he turned to the study of Philosophy in Zurich. In 1907, he married Blanche Hardy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/Schlick-Projekt/biographie.html Biography] at [[Vienna University]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, he published ''Lebensweisheit'' (&quot;The Wisdom of Life&quot;), a slim volume about [[eudaemonism]], the theory that happiness is the highest ethical pursuit. His habilitation essay, &quot;Das Wesen der Wahrheit nach der modernen Logik&quot; (&quot;The Nature of Truth According to Modern [[Logic]]&quot;), was published in 1910. Several essays about [[aesthetics]] followed, whereupon Schlick turned his attention to problems of [[epistemology]], the [[philosophy of science]], and more general questions about [[science]]. In this last category, Schlick distinguished himself by publishing a paper in 1915  about [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]], a topic only ten years old. He also published ''Raum und Zeit in der gegenwärtigen Physik'' (&quot;Space and Time in Modern Physics&quot;), which extended his earlier results by  applying Poincaré's geometric conventionalism to explain Einstein's adoption of a non-Euclidean geometry in the General Theory of Relativity.

Schmitt wrote extensively about the effective wielding of political power. His work has been a major influence on subsequent political theory, legal theory, continental philosophy and political theology.

Schmitt's work has attracted the attention of numerous philosophers and political theorists, including [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;William E. Scheuerman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECGIYNWdaX0C&amp;dq= ''Carl Schmitt: The End of Law''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Susan Buck-Morss]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Jaime Guzmán]], [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]] among many others. Much of his work remains both influential and controversial presently due to his association with [[Nazism]], for which he is known as the &quot;crown jurist of the Third Reich&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2127676 Carl Schmitt's Concept of the Political, Charles E.

'''Sextus Empiricus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Σέξτος Ἐμπειρικός}}; c. 160 – 210 CE), was a [[physician]] and [[philosopher]], and has been variously reported to have lived in [[Alexandria]], [[Rome]], or [[Athens]].  His philosophical work is the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman [[skepticism]].

In his medical work, tradition maintains that he belonged to the &quot;[[empiric school]]&quot;, as reflected by his name.  However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the &quot;[[methodic school]]&quot;, as his philosophical views imply.

== Writings ==
Sextus Empiricus's three known works are the ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' (Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις, ''Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis'', thus commonly abbreviated ''PH''), and two distinct works preserved under the same title, ''Against the Mathematicians'' (''Adversus Mathematicos''), one of which is probably incomplete.

'''Herbert Spencer''' (27 April 1820 – 8 December 1903) was an English philosopher, [[biologist]], [[anthropologist]], [[sociologist]], and prominent [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[political theorist]] of the [[Victorian era]].

Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of [[evolutionism|evolution]] as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. He was &quot;an enthusiastic exponent of evolution&quot; and even &quot;wrote about evolution before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] did.&quot;&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;Riggenbach, Jeff (24 April 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5206/The-Real-William-Graham-Sumner The Real William Graham Sumner], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[polymath]], he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, biology, sociology, and psychology.

'''Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler''' (29 May 1880 – 8 May 1936) was a German [[historian]] and [[Philosophy of history|philosopher of history]] whose interests included mathematics, science, and art. He is best known for his book ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (''Der Untergang des Abendlandes''), published in 1918 and 1922, covering all of world history. Spengler's civilization model postulates that any [[civilization]] is a [[superorganism]] with a limited and predictable lifespan.

He wrote extensively throughout [[World War I]] and the [[interwar period]], and supported German hegemony in Europe. His other writings made little impact outside Germany. In 1920 Spengler produced ''[[Preussentum und Sozialismus|Prussiandom and Socialism]]'' (''Preußentum und Sozialismus''), which argued for an organic, nationalist brand of non-Marxist socialism and authoritarianism. Some [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], including [[Joseph Goebbels]], saw Spengler as an intellectual precursor, but he was ultimately ostracized by the Nazis in 1933 for his pessimism about the future of Germany and Europe, his refusal to support [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi ideas]] of [[Master race|racial superiority]], and his critical work ''The Hour of Decision''.

Speusippus was [[Plato]]'s nephew by his sister [[Potone]].  After Plato's death, Speusippus inherited the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] and remained its head for the next eight years.  However, following a stroke, he passed the chair to [[Xenocrates]]. Although the successor to Plato in the Academy, he frequently diverged from Plato's teachings. He rejected Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], and whereas Plato had identified the [[Form of the Good|Good]] with the ultimate ''principle'', Speusippus maintained that the Good was merely secondary. He also argued that it is impossible to have satisfactory [[knowledge]] of any thing without knowing all the differences by which it is separated from everything else.

The standard edition of the surviving fragments and testimonies is Leonardo Tarán's ''Speusippus of Athens: A Critical Study with a Collection of the Related Texts and Commentary'' (1982).

==Life==
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak was born in Ballygunge, Kolkata on February 24, 1942. She graduated from the [[St. John’s Diocesan Girls High School]] in 1955. She received a Sangeet Visharad degree in North Indian Classical Music in Bhatkhande Academy in 1953. She graduated from the [[Lady Brabourne College]] in Intermediate Science from the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1957, with a First Class degree, coming first in English among all students at the university. She graduated from the Presidency College, University of Calcutta, in 1959 with a first class first BA in English Honors. She also came first in Bengali literature among all the students at the university. In 1959 she was the National Debating champion of India; she had already been placed as an honorary member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly by Justice Ajit Nath Ray in 1956 for her debating skills, equal in English and Bengali. She lost her father in 1955, and in 1959, upon graduation, secured employment as an English tutor for forty hours a week, in addition to working for her MA at the university. In 1961, she joined the graduate program in English at Cornell University, travelling on money borrowed on a so-called “life mortgage.” In 1962, unable to secure financial aid from the department of English, she transferred to Comparative Literature, a new program at Cornell, under the guidance of its first Director, Paul de Man, with insufficient preparation in French and German. It is interesting to note that it did not occur to her to declare her mother tongue as a foreign language.

At Cornell, she wrote her MA thesis on the representation of innocence in Wordsworth with M.H. Abrams. In 1963-64, she attended Girton College, Cambridge, as a research student under the supervision of Professor T.R. Henn, writing on the representation of the stages of development of the lyric subject in the poetry of William Butler Yeats. She presented a course in the summer of 1963 on “Yeats and the Theme of Death” at the Yeats Summer School in Sligo, Ireland. (She returned there in 1987 to present Yeats’ position within post-coloniality.)

In the Fall of 1965, Spivak became an assistant professor in the department of English, University of Iowa. She received tenure in 1970. She did not publish her doctoral dissertation, but decided to write a critical book on Yeats that would be accessible to her undergraduate students without compromising her intellectual positions. The result is her first book, written for young adults, Myself I Must Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats.

In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, the movement arts (developing a new artistic form, ''[[eurythmy]]'') and architecture, culminating in the building of the [[Goetheanum]], a cultural centre to house [[Gesamtkunstwerk|all the arts]]. In the third phase of his work, beginning after [[World War I]], Steiner worked to establish various [[#Breadth of activity|practical endeavors]], including [[Waldorf education]], [[Biodynamic Agriculture|biodynamic agriculture]], and [[anthroposophical medicine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CL&quot;&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, ISBN 3-499-50500-2, pp. 123–6&lt;/ref&gt;

This work was first published in 1845 in [[Leipzig]], and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

'''Carl Stumpf''' ({{IPA-de|ʃtʊmpf|lang}}; 21 April 1848 – 25 December 1936) was a [[germany|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Psychology|psychologist]]. He studied with [[Franz Brentano]] at the University of Würzburg before receiving his doctorate at University of Göttingen in 1868. At Göttingen, he also worked and [[Hermann Lotze]], who is famous for his work in perception. Stumpf is known for his work on the ''psychology of tones''. He had an important influence on his students [[Wolfgang Köhler]] and [[Kurt Koffka]] who were instrumental in the founding of [[Gestalt psychology|''Gestalt'' psychology]] as well as [[Kurt Lewin]], who was also a part of the Gestalt group and was key in the establishment of experimental social psychology in America. Stumpf is considered one of the pioneers of [[comparative musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]], as documented in his study of the origins of human musical cognition [[The Origins of Music]] (1911). He held positions in the philosophy departments at the Universities of Göttingen, Würzburg, Prague, Munich and Halle, before obtaining a professorship at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stumpf/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johannes Nikolaus Tetens''' (16 September 1736 – 17 August 1807) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]], [[statistician]] and [[scientist]].

He has been called 'the German Hume', on the basis of a comparison of his major work ''Philosophische Versuche über die menschliche Natur und ihre Entwickelung'' (1777) with [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. He is considered to have been an influence on [[Immanuel Kant]].

Born 1736 in [[Tetenbüll|Tetenbüll/Tetenbøl]] ([[Eiderstedt]] in the Danish [[Duchy of Schleswig]]). From 1760, he taught philosophy and physics (&quot;natural philosophy&quot; by that time) in the [[Buetzow]] Academy ([[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]]). During this decade, he wrote many treatises on various subjects, ranging from the color of the sky to the [[existence of God]] through the origins of languages (see e. g. references in [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]], 1863). After this polygraphic formation period, Tetens goes back to more fundamental enquiries: after having read [[David Hume]]'s work, he popularized it throughout the German-speaking world. Tetens is therefore supposed to have introduced [[Immanuel Kant]] to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] thought and to the [[empiricism]] / [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] dualism.

In 1776, Tetens became Professor of Philosophy at the University of [[Kiel]], which might have appeared to be his final professional position.  Nonetheless, in the years following 1789, Tetens begun another career as a high ranking Danish civil servant: member of the Finanzcollegium in [[Copenhagen]], then (1791) counselor of state, and (1803) co-director of the state bank and director of the widow pension funds. By this time, he was interested in pure maths as well as in applications. His interest in polynomial algebra was influenced by his belonging to the German combinatorial school of Carl Friederich Hindenburg, [[Christian Kramp]] and others. His main applied work was concentrated on actuarial mathematics.

Many, most notably [[Aristotle]], regard him as the first philosopher in the [[Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CPM&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Smith|title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year = 1870|url = https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/1016|page = 1016|first = Sir William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle reported Thales' [[hypothesis]] that the [[Arche|originating principle]] of [[nature]] and the nature of [[matter]] was a single material [[Substance theory|substance]]: [[Water (classical element)|water]].

Thales attempted to explain natural phenomena without reference to [[mythology]]. Almost all of the other [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers follow him in attempting to provide an explanation of ultimate substance, change, and the existence of the world without reference to mythology.

In [[mathematics]], Thales used [[geometry]] to calculate the heights of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to use [[deductive reasoning]] applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]]. He is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Ionia and the Pythagoreans&quot; p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is known for her defense of moral objectivity, her account of moral rights, her views about the incompleteness of the term 'good,'  and her use of [[thought experiments]] to make philosophical points.  She wrote a 1971 essay &quot;[[A Defense of Abortion]]&quot;, which bases abortion rights on the pregnant woman's right to control her own body and its life-support functions, rather than attempting to deny the personhood of the fetus.

In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. ''Democracy in America'' was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and [[political science]].

'''Alan Wilson Watts''' (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British-born American [[philosopher]], writer, and speaker, best known as an interpreter and populariser of [[Eastern philosophy]] for a [[Western culture|Western]] audience. Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], where he received a master's degree in [[theology]]. Watts became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest in 1945, then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].

Watts gained a large following in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] while working as a volunteer programmer at [[KPFA]], a [[Pacifica Radio]] station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to [[Eastern religion|Eastern]] and [[Western religion]], introducing the then-[[Counterculture of the 1960s|burgeoning youth culture]] to ''The Way of Zen'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on [[Buddhism]]. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]] and not a religion. He considered &quot;Nature, Man, and Woman&quot; (1958) to be, &quot;from a literary point of view - the best book I have ever written.&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He also explored human consciousness, in the essay &quot;The New Alchemy&quot; (1958), and in the book ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).

After her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks due to poor health and to devote herself to [[political activism]], work that would see her assisting in the trade union movement, taking the side of the [[Anarchism in Spain#Anarchist presence in the Spanish Civil War|Anarchists]] known as the [[Durruti Column]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and spending more than a year working as a labourer, mostly in auto factories, so she could better understand the working class.

'''Otto Weininger''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvaɪnɪŋɐ|lang}}; April 3, 1880 – October 4, 1903) was an Austrian [[philosopher]]. In 1903, he published the book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]''), which gained popularity after his suicide at the age of 23. Today, Weininger is viewed as [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] in academic circles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Harrowitz | editor1-first = Nancy | editor2-last = Hyams | editor2-first = Barbara | title =Jews and Gender: Responses to Otto Weininger| location =Philadelphia|publisher = Temple University Press| year = 1995 | ISBN = 1-56639-249-7}} See, for example, {{nowrap|pp.&amp;#8239;223–4}}, which speak of &quot;Weininger's misogynist, and perhaps also anti-Semitic, ideologies&quot;, though {{Nowrap|p.&amp;#8239;91}} mentions &quot;a reevaluation of his work ... show[ing] how misleading it is to dismiss Weininger as a misogynist and Jewish self-hater&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; but was held to be a great genius by the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the writer [[August Strindberg]] (see discussion below).

'''Alfred North Whitehead''', [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|OM]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (15 February 1861&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1947) was an English mathematician and philosopher.  He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as [[process philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), vii.&lt;/ref&gt; which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology, among other areas.

In his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–13), which he co-wrote with former student [[Bertrand Russell]]. ''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;&quot;The Modern Library's Top 100 Nonfiction Books of the Century&quot;, last modified April 30, 1999, ''[[New York Times]]'', accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/042999best-nonfiction-list.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Windelband grab.JPG|thumb|His grave in Heidelberg]]
Windelband is now mainly remembered for the terms ''[[nomothetic]]'' and ''[[idiographic]]'', which he introduced. These have currency in [[psychology]] and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a neo-Kantian who protested other neo-Kantians of his time and maintained that &quot;to understand [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] rightly means to go beyond him&quot;. Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to [[psychologism]] and [[historicism]] schools by a critical philosophic system.

'''William Wollaston''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|ə|s|t|ən}}; 26 March 1659 – 29 October 1724) was school teacher, a [[Church of England]] priest, a scholar of Latin, Greek and Hebrew, a theologian, and a major [[Age of enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] English philosopher. He is remembered today for one book, which he completed only two years before his death: ''[http://fair-use.org/william-wollaston/the-religion-of-nature-delineated/ The Religion of Nature Delineated]'' (1st ed. 1722; 2nd ed. 1724). Yet despite his cloistered life and his single book, due to his influence on eighteenth-century philosophy and his promotion of a Natural Religion, he may be considered one of the great British Enlightenment philosophers, along with [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. His work contributed to the development of two important intellectual schools: British Deism, and &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; moral philosophy of American Practical Idealism.  It appears notably in the ''Declaration of Independence''.

==Life==
Wollaston was born at [[Coton Clanford]] in Staffordshire, on 26 March 1659. He was born to a family long-established in Staffordshire, and was distantly related to Sir John Wollaston, the Alderman and [[Lord Mayor of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clarke (dean of Salisbury)|John Clarke]], [http://fair-use.org/william-wollaston/the-religion-of-nature-delineated/preface A Preface ''containing'' A General Account of the Life, Character, and Writings of the ''Author''], ''The Religion of Nature Delineated'', 1750 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his family was not wealthy. At the age of ten, he began school at a Latin school newly opened in [[Shenstone, Staffordshire]], and continued in country free schools until he was admitted to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], at the age of 15, in June 1674.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLSN674W|name=Wollaston, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his writings it is clear that he was an excellent scholar, &quot;extremely well versed&quot; in languages and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann, Alexander, &quot;William Wollaston (1659–1724): English Deist and Rabbinic Scholar&quot;, ''Transactions (Jewish Historical Society of England)'', Vol. 16, (1945–1951), pp. 185–211&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last year at Cambridge, Wollaston published anonymously a small book, ''On the Design of the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]], or the Unreasonableness of Men's Restless Contention for the Present Enjoyments, represented in an English Poem'' (London, 1691). Apparently embarrassed by his own work, Wollaston almost immediately suppressed it.

'''Crispin James Garth Wright''' ({{IPAc-en|r|aɪ|t}}; born 1942) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher, who has written on [[neo-Fregeanism|neo-Fregean]] [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[Wittgenstein]]'s later [[philosophy]], and on issues related to [[truth]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]], [[skepticism]], [[knowledge]], and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].

He was born in Surrey and was educated at [[Birkenhead School]] (1950–61) and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in Moral Sciences in 1964 and taking a PhD in 1968. He took an Oxford BPhil in 1969 and was elected Prize Fellow and then Research Fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where he worked until 1978. He then moved to the [[University of St. Andrews]], where he was appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics and then the first Bishop Wardlaw University
Professorship in 1997. As of fall 2008, he is professor at [[New York University]] (NYU).  He has also taught at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Oxford University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Princeton University]]. Crispin Wright is founder and director of [[Arché]], which he left in September 2009 to take up leadership of the new Northern Institute of Philosophy (NIP) at the [[University of Aberdeen]].

In the philosophy of mathematics, he is best known for his book ''Frege's Conception of Numbers as Objects'' (1983), where he argues that Frege's [[logicism|logicist]] project could be revived by removing the [[Axiom schema of specification#Unrestricted comprehension|Principle of Unrestricted Comprehension]] (sometimes referred to as Basic Law V) from the [[formal system]].  [[Arithmetic]] is then derivable in [[second-order logic]] from [[Hume's principle]].  He gives informal [[argument]]s that (i) [[David Hume|Hume]]'s [[principle]] plus second-order logic is [[consistency|consistent]], and (ii) from it one can produce the [[Peano axioms|Dedekind–Peano axioms]].  Both results were [[proof (mathematics)|proven]] informally by Gottlob Frege ([[Frege's Theorem]]), and would later be more rigorously proven by [[George Boolos]] and Richard Heck. Wright is one of the major proponents of [[neo-logicism]], alongside his frequent collaborator [[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]]. He has also written ''Wittgenstein and the Foundations of Mathematics'' (1980).

In general metaphysics, his most important work is ''Truth and Objectivity'' (Harvard University Press, 1992). He argues in this book that there need be no single, discourse-invariant thing in which [[truth]] consists, making an analogy with [[identity (social science)|identity]]. There need only be some [[principle]]s regarding how the truth [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] can be applied to a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], some 'platitudes' about true sentences. Wright also argues that in some contexts, probably including [[morality|moral]] contexts, ''superassertibility'' will effectively function as a truth predicate. He [[stipulative definition|defines]] a predicate as superassertible if and only if it is &quot;[[Assertiveness|assertible]]&quot; in some state of information and then remains so no matter how that state of information is enlarged upon or improved. Assertiveness is [[Theory of justification|warrant]] by whatever standards inform the [[discourse]] in question.

Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Chalcedon]] was a [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]], [[Greek Mathematics|mathematician]], and leader ([[scholarch]]) of the [[Platonic Academy]] from 339/8 to 314/3 BC. His teachings followed those of [[Plato]], which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements. He distinguished three forms of being, the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, [[sense]], [[intellect]] and [[opinion]]. Unity and duality he considered to be [[gods]] which rule the [[universe]], and the soul is a self-moving [[number]]. [[God]] pervades all things, and there are [[Daemon (mythology)|daemonical]] powers, intermediate between the [[Divinity|divine]] and the [[Human|mortal]], which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that [[mathematical]] objects and the [[Theory of Forms|Platonic Ideas]] are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. In [[Ethics]], he taught that [[virtue]] produces [[happiness]], but that external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose.

'''Peter Wessel Zapffe''' (December 18, 1899&amp;nbsp;– October 12, 1990) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[metaphysician]], author and [[mountaineer]]. He is often noted for his [[Pessimism#Philosophical pessimism|philosophically pessimistic]] and fatalistic view of human existence&lt;ref name=&quot;Zapffe2&quot;&gt;Tangenes, Gisle, {{cite web | title=The view from mt Zapffe | work=Philosophy Now | url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/45/The_View_from_Mount_Zapffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;—his system of philosophy in line with the work of the earlier philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], by whom he was inspired—as well as his firm advocacy of [[antinatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Zapffe remarked that children are brought into the world without consent or forethought: &lt;blockquote&gt;In accordance with my conception of life, I have chosen not to bring children into the world. A coin is examined, and only after careful deliberation, given to a beggar, whereas a child is flung out into the cosmic brutality without hesitation. (''To Be a Human Being'' (1989–90); the philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe in his 90th year (1990 documentary, Tromsø Norway: [http://www.originalfilm.no/en/productions/zapffe.html Original Film AS])).&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts regarding the error of human life are presented in the essay &quot;[[The Last Messiah]]&quot; (Norwegian: ''Den sidste Messias'', 1933). This essay is a shorter version of his best-known work, the philosophical treatise ''[[On the Tragic]]'' (''Om det tragiske'', 1941).

==Contentions==
Zapffe's [[theory]] is that humans are born with an overdeveloped skill (understanding, self-knowledge) which does not fit into nature's design. The human craving for justification on matters such as life and death cannot be satisfied, hence [[human race|humanity]] has a need that [[nature]] cannot satisfy. The tragedy, following this theory, is that humans spend all their time trying not to be human. The human being, therefore, is a [[paradox]].

'''Zeno of Citium''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Ζήνων ὁ Κιτιεύς}}, ''Zēnōn ho Kitieus''; c. 334 – c. 262 BC) was a Greek thinker&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/656527/Zeno-Of-Citium Zeno-Of-Citium Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Kition|Citium]] ({{lang|el|Κίτιον}}, ''Kition''), [[Cyprus]]. He was possibly of [[Phoenicia]]n descent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwyn Bevan]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=M8R1OzqNS20C&amp;pg=PA15 Stoics and Sceptics]''&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno was the founder of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of philosophy, which he taught in [[Athens]] from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], Stoicism laid great emphasis on [[good and evil|goodness]] and [[calmness|peace of mind]] gained from living a life of [[Virtue]] in accordance with [[Nature]]. It proved very successful, and flourished as the dominant philosophy from the [[Hellenistic period]] through to the [[Roman era]].

[[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], 8.57, 9.25&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], which [[Bertrand Russell]] has described as &quot;immeasurably subtle and profound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1996 [1903]), p. 347: &quot;In this capricious world nothing is more capricious than posthumous fame. One of the most notable victims of posterity's lack of judgement is the Eleatic Zeno. Having invented four arguments all immeasurably subtle and profound, the grossness of subsequent philosophers pronounced him to be a mere ingenious juggler, and his arguments to be one and all sophisms. After two thousand years of continual refutation, these sophisms were reinstated, and made the foundation of a mathematical renaissance...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Little is known for certain about Zeno's life. Although written nearly a century after Zeno's death, the primary source of biographical information about Zeno is [[Plato]]'s ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]] (c. 380 – 367 BC). [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/parmenides.html ''Parmenides''], translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]]. Internet Classics Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also mentioned in Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (c. mid 4th century BC), ''Physics'' 233a and 239b&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue of ''Parmenides'', Plato describes a visit to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by Zeno and Parmenides, at a time when Parmenides is &quot;about 65,&quot;  Zeno is &quot;nearly 40&quot; and [[Socrates]] is &quot;a very young man&quot;.&lt;ref name=parm&gt;Plato, ''Parmenides'' 127b–e&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming an age for Socrates of around 20, and taking the date of Socrates' birth as 469 BC gives an approximate date of birth for Zeno of 490 BC. Plato says that Zeno was &quot;tall and fair to look upon&quot; and was &quot;in the days of his youth … reported to have been beloved by Parmenides.&quot;&lt;ref name=parm /&gt;

'''Slavoj Žižek''' ({{IPA-sl|ˈslavoj ˈʒiʒɛk|Slovene:|Zizek - the correct Slavoj Žižek pronunciation.ogg}}; born 21 March 1949) is a Slovenian psycho-analytic [[philosopher]], [[cultural critic]], and a [[Marxist]] scholar. He is a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the [[University of Ljubljana]], Global Distinguished Professor of German at [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Faculty|url=http://german.as.nyu.edu/page/people|publisher=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international director of the [[Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bih/aboutus/staff/zizek&lt;/ref&gt; His work is located at the intersection of a range of disciplines, including [[continental philosophy]], [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[film criticism]], and [[theology]].

Born in [[Slovenia]] and educated in [[Ljubljana]] and later [[Paris]], Žižek first achieved international recognition after the 1989 publication of his first English text, ''[[The Sublime Object of Ideology]]'', in which he departed from traditional [[Marxist]] theory to develop a [[materialist]] conception of [[ideology]] that drew heavily on [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] and [[Hegelian idealism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Slavoj-Zizek ''Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iep.utm.edu&quot;&gt;&quot;Slavoj Žižek,&quot; by Matthew Sharpe, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, http://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/. 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic [[leftism|Left]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Boyle. &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Slavoj Žižek’s Psychoanalytic Marxism.&quot; ''International Journal of Žižek  Studies''.
